BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "At Your Beck and Call" segment tonight, two hot topics: the writer Stephen King criticizes the G-man and President Obama using the Internet to promote Obamacare. I spoke with Beck last night.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: So here's our pal Beck who, of course, keeps a close eye on the president of the United States. That's your job, correct?
GLENN BECK, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yes.
O'REILLY: You have to watch. That eye.
BECK: That eye.
O'REILLY: And lately, the president has been trying to sell his Obamacare program on the Internet.
BECK: Yes.
O'REILLY: I want -- I want to get your reaction, Beck, to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Hello, everybody. I want to talk with you about a new consumer website, Healthcare.gov. It's a good resource for understanding the new law. Let me show you how it works. Now I have pretty good health care these days, but let's roll back the clock to when Michelle and I were just getting started in Chicago. From the homepage, I choose my state. Then answer a few more questions. No matter your age or situation, there's something for everyone at Healthcare.gov.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: OK. And then it's a dating service, too, I think.
BECK: Call now.
O'REILLY: Right.
BECK: Operators are standing by.
O'REILLY: Putting healthy people together.
BECK: If he could just put some nice car wax on that computer and rub and rub and rub and then set it on fire, wouldn't it -- now how much would you pay, America? Got a president who's doing a pitch man.
O'REILLY: He's trying to help you navigate.
BECK: Oh, he is trying to help.
O'REILLY: Through the 1,200 pages.
BECK: I like him. Hi, I'm Glenn Beck. I'd like to sell you something now. Come over to my conveniently placed computer over here.
O'REILLY: Are you mocking the president of the United States?
BECK: Me?
O'REILLY: Yes. Is that what you're doing? How subversive of you.
BECK: I'm dead serious.
O'REILLY: Let's talk about this in a serious vein for once.
BECK: Uh-huh.
O'REILLY: OK? Twelve hundred page Obamacare legislation, 1,200. All right? Don't you think there should be a government website...
BECK: Twenty-five hundred.
O'REILLY: I think it came down to 12 at one point. But you could be right. Whatever it is, it's enormous. Nobody read it. He didn't read it. Nobody read it. Shouldn't there be a website funded by the government that shows people what this actually is, what your choices are? Isn't that a good thing, Beck?
BECK: See what he's doing? That's a rhetorical question. That's what he promised he was going to do.
O'REILLY: But he's -- isn't it a good thing to have that kind of a facility?
BECK: Is it just -- is it just me?
O'REILLY: It is. It's just you.
BECK: Am I on "Candid Camera"? Yes, it's a good thing.
O'REILLY: Thank you.
BECK: It's a good thing if -- here's an idea -- before he signs it, he reads it. Before the people actually deal with it.
O'REILLY: Deal with the website. So you think it's a good thing, right?
BECK: Is this a trick question? Yes.
O'REILLY: All right. Good, I'm glad. Now, is his presentation, does that offend you?
BECK: No. No.
O'REILLY: Will you answer the question before I slap you?
BECK: Maybe I like that. No, his presentation...
O'REILLY: Did it offend you?
BECK: As the president, he's...
O'REILLY: He's trying to help you out.
BECK: Like a late-night pitchman on TV?
O'REILLY: No, it is a little...
BECK: I want to buy floor wax from that man.
O'REILLY: It is -- that's a legitimate point. Does it...
BECK: Here's what offended me.
O'REILLY: Does it diminish the presidency to have him do it?
BECK: To be a pitchman.
O'REILLY: Would Woodrow Wilson have done it?
BECK: Yes, he would have.
O'REILLY: OK.
BECK: Yes, he would have.
O'REILLY: Do you like it then?
BECK: I don't like it!
O'REILLY: So No. 1, you don't have a -- you don't have a beef with the website in general. It could be used for good purposes. But you think it diminishes the president of the United States.
BECK: To do the pitch thing, yes.
O'REILLY: OK.
BECK: I think it's a little bit beneath the president of the United States but, you know, here's the offensive part of that, you know, is when he started talking about, "And I got a letter from little 4-year-old Bobby who writes, 'I lost both my eyes, and an unscrupulous doctor took them out and replaced them with cheaper marbles'." When -- I'm tired of the stories that little Bobby and the health care. I'm tired of them.
O'REILLY: Because you're mean. Most people sympathize with Bobby.
BECK: No -- I sell -- I sell marbles…
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: …to unscrupulous people.
O'REILLY: All right. Do you know who this guy, Stephen King, is?
BECK: Who?
O'REILLY: Stephen King. Do you know him, the author?
BECK: Oh, yes. He's the guy that usually when I release my books at the same time, he's No. 2.
O'REILLY: OK. So you think he's jealous of you. He lives up in Maine, this guy. He writes about spooky things.
BECK: Yes. Actually...
O'REILLY: A little like you.
BECK: …I am a huge fan.
O'REILLY: "The Overton Window," very, very frightening. So maybe he's jealous. But this is what he...
BECK: Biggest selling fiction of the -- of the year.
O'REILLY: Of the year. Your book. Not Stephen King. You.
BECK: Huh?
O'REILLY: Here's what King writes in Entertainment Weekly.
BECK: Yes.
O'REILLY: Let me quote it to you: "I sort of dig on Glenn Beck. He reminds me of certain people you encounter in big cities. You know, the ones wearing robes, sandals and signs but claiming the world is going to end because American men are eating too much red meat and American women are wearing their pants too tight. He's crazy, but like those urban nut cakes, he actually seems to believe what he is saying." Stephen King.
BECK: I think he meant that in a good way.
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: No, look, here's the thing. So what he's saying is you're a nut cake. But I'm a sincere nut cake.
O'REILLY: That's true.
BECK: I'm sincerely crazy.
O'REILLY: Uh-huh.
BECK: I appreciate that, Stephen. Stephen King is the guy who called me Satan's younger brother. And if I'm not mistaken, called Bill O'Reilly Satan's mentally challenged older brother.
O'REILLY: You would come off better.
BECK: I'm the younger brother.
O'REILLY: Right.
BECK: He got that right.
O'REILLY: I'm old and mentally challenged.
BECK: Not too much. Not too much.
O'REILLY: Here's my question: Should you and I take the "Bold Fresh" Tour up to Maine?
BECK: Yes. I would love that.
O'REILLY: OK.
BECK: Could we?
O'REILLY: And rent a place near King's place and then, after the show, lead the whole crew over to his house for coffee.
BECK: We could gather arms and -- I mean, lock arms, not gather arms. That would be crazy. Lock arms and sing "Kumbaya." And then he can come out and tell us spooky stories.
O'REILLY: You know...
BECK: I'll wear a sandwich sign.
O'REILLY: I used to think that I was the most misunderstood person.
BECK: Right.
O'REILLY: But now, I know that I'm not.
BECK: Yes, no. It's Stephen King.
O'REILLY: Right. There you go. Glenn Beck, everybody.
