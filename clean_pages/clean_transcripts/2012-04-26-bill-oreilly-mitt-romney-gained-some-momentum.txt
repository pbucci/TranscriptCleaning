The Governor had a good night last night winning all the primaries and getting prime time exposure to tell the country just why President Obama is misguided.

MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The government is at the center of his vision. It dispenses the benefits, borrows what it can't take, consumes a greater and greater share of the economy. You know, with ObamaCare fully installed, government would have control of almost half of the economy. And we would have effectively ceased to be a free enterprise society.
This President is putting us on a path where our lives will be ruled by bureaucrats and boards, commissions and czars. He is asking us to accept that Washington knows best and to provide all.

O'REILLY: And that will be the theme of Romney's campaign throughout the rest of the year. That Mr. Obama is a far-left guy who wants to constrain individual freedom.
For his part the President knows he's going to be defined as a militant progressive. But it doesn't seem to bother him. His theme this week is that college loans should be kept at 3.4 percent.

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And Michelle and I, we financed basically our entire college and law school educations with… with loans and debt and for the first 10 years of our marriage we were still paying stuff off even when we are supposed to be saving for Malia and Sasha.

O'REILLY: Here's a back story on that in 2007 the Democratic Congress okayed the low college interest rate but allowed it to lapse in 2012.
So the President is running around college campuses saying he wants to keep the rate low, fine. At this point nobody is objecting. There is no issue. The rate is going to be kept down, 3.4 percent.
But Mr. Obama uses any and all opportunity to tell Americans that he is there for us. That his administration will provide. Therefore it is a race between a self-reliance guy Romney and a provider Obama.
"Talking Points" has said this before. Mitt Romney will model his campaign on the 1980 Ronald Reagan run. Back then Jimmy Carter was the progressive guy and the economy was in big trouble. Governor Reagan define Carter as far left and asked the compelling question “are you better off than you were four years ago”. Guess what Romney asked last night?

ROMNEY: Four years ago Barack Obama dazzled us in front of Greek columns with sweeping promises of hope and change. But after we came down to earth, after all the celebration and the parades, what do we have to show for three and a half years of President Obama?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: So there you have it. Romney running as Reagan, Obama running as Obama. And the American people forced to decide whether they want unfettered capitalism or a federal provider.
And that's “The Memo.”

Pinheads and Patriots
Far-left actor Sean Penn received a humanitarian award recently and described himself this way.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN PENN, ACTOR/ACTIVIST: I am very pro-American in the sense of the constitutional America. And I'm very pro-American in terms of a diverse America and one where we do reach out and understand that to be too monocultural is to limit ourselves and create the insecurity that we're currently facing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: What? No idea. I have no idea what Mr. Penn just said. I listened to it. I read the text five times. I just don't know. So I cannot make him a "Patriot" or a "Pinhead" for that remark, but you might be able to.
But I do have some advice for Sean Penn. Go to the same barber Miller did.
