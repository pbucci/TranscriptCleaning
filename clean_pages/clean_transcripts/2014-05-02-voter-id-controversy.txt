O'REILLY: "Unresolved Problems" segment tonight requiring IDs to vote the left says it's unfair to the poor it is unfair to require proof that you are a citizen, that's unfair? The left also say there is no voter fraud.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ALAN COLMES, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Voter I.D. fraud does not take place in the voting booth it happens when you register to vote.
CENK UYGUR, LIBERAL COMMENTATOR: You're much more likely to be killed by a hippopotamus than you are to see in person voter fraud. This is nonsense.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Voter fraud is a red herring.
REV. JESSE JACKSON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There is not a crisis in voter fraud.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Well, that's interesting because according to a new report from the Virginia Voters Alliance at least 164 people voted in two states, Maryland and Virginia on presidential Election Day 2012. And there are scores of other voter fraud cases being investigated all across the country right now.
Yet, the "New York Times" says, quote, "such voter fraud is basically nonexistent. The real point is to deter from the polls significant numbers of Democratic voters, particularly minorities and the poor" unquote.
So the "New York Times" opposes an I.D. card to vote. But the paper supports a New York City photo I.D. card that would give illegal aliens quasi-legal status. "The Times" writes quote, "Benefits for card holders are obvious. An I.D. would make it vastly easier to navigate through life" unquote.
So we are all clear, the "New York Times" doesn't want voter IDs but does want I.D. cards for illegal aliens so their lives will be easier.
With us now Andrea Tantaros she co-host of "THE FIVE" and new program at noon, "OUTNUMBERED", and from New Orleans Democratic James Carville. So Carville --
(CROSSTALK)
JAMES CARVILLE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi.
O'REILLY: Do you see a contradiction in the "New York Times" stance.
CARVILLE: Look I'm not defending "New York Times." Voter fraud is an infinitesimal (ph) problem; it barely exists. And what -- and the head of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, the majority leader of Pennsylvania House said the reason that they passed this was so Romney could win the state. I mean everybody knows what this is.
O'REILLY: I don't know what it is. I mean, I know I'm not as smart as you are. But I think it's just a logical request for anyone when they show at the polls -- at the polls and says who are you? Hi, who are you?
CARVILLE: We know -- why there is not a problem in voter fraud in this country.
O'REILLY: I just gave you the stats, ok, man?
CARVILLE: What stat no the stats are the Bush justice department made it a priority. They investigated with the FBI and everybody between 2002 and 2005. Out of 197 million votes cast, they were able to secure 26 convictions. That's 0.0000123. It is an infinitesimal problem --
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: So I don't really care because --
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Ok sure it is. And their stats have not been questioned and they produced evidence to back it up. Now the national I.D. card is not only used for voting --
CARVILLE: Again what -- you are telling this is not a partisan group in Virginia. You are saying this is not a partisan group in Virginia?
O'REILLY: I'm saying that their data has not been questioned by anyone.
CARVILLE: the Bush justice department 197,000,026.
O'REILLY: I head it. All right, I heard it. Now, an I.D. card to vote also can be used in employment.
ANDREA TANTAROS, CO-HOST, "OUTNUMBERED": That's right?
O'REILLY: Social security fraud, all of the other things. And it will come and have to come because of the massive amount of fraud and entitlements. But let's get back to the "New York Times" question that Carville dodged, all right? They want the voter I.D. for the illegal aliens.
TANTAROS: That's right.
O'REILLY: They don't want the voter I.D. for the polling place.
TANTAROS: It doesn't make any sense. Yes. They want a municipal I.D.
O'REILLY: Right.
TANTAROS: But they don't want people to have to be able to use it in any other polling place? It doesn't make any sense. The stats that you quoted, Bill, let's take them on their face. Let's just say that it's this minimal problem. There have been 83 murders in New York City out of eight million. Are the liberals going to argue that murder is not a problem?
I think this points to a bigger issue that James and his buddies are nervous that they have to gin up a base by creating an issue about voter fraud and suppression and saying that it doesn't exist when we know that -- James we know it exits. I'm just really disappointed that liberals are running into the midterms defending fraud. You are defending a crime.
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Let's be fair to Carville he is not defending the crime.
CARVILLE: I'm not defending.
O'REILLY: He doesn't want to prevent the crime.
TANTAROS: Ok.
CARVILLE: So don't tell why the leader of the House Republicans in Pennsylvania said we did this because Romney can now --
O'REILLY: I don't know who that is Carville.
CARVILLE: I can do fact check.
O'REILLY: You can point to crazy people anywhere. There's massive amount of entitlement fraud in this country.
CARVILLE: This has nothing to do with voter ID.
O'REILLY: Every citizen should have an I.D. card. Everyone and that would cut down on fraud and a lot of different areas. And it will happen you will see.
CARVILLE: It is a barely existent problem.
O'REILLY: All right.
TANTAROS: But it's still a problem and it's sad that he's defending it. It's really sad that the left is defending this issue. And you are doing it to get votes. These municipal cards are so that illegal immigrants can get healthcare and Social Security and all these other things. It's just sad that this is the difference between the left and the right. We do not make excuses for crimes and fraud. We try to fix it.
O'REILLY: All right I've got to go.
CARVILLE: Ok thank you.
