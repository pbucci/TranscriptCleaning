O'REILLY: "Watters' World" segment tonight, technology changing very rapidly, and soon, your car will be a place you will not even recognize. So we sent Jesse Watters out to the car show here in New York City for a look at the future.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JESSE WATTERS, "FACTOR" PRODUCER: Are you a car fanatic?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love cars. That's why I'm at the auto show.
WATTERS: Would you ever buy a Dodge Viper?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No trust in American cars.
WATTERS: You buy American because you're a patriot, right?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, absolutely.
WATTERS: What kind of car is this?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a Mercedes SLS.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Rolls Royce Phantom Series 2.
WATTERS: And how much does it cost?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: About 200 plus.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Three hundred ninety-eight thousand.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I'm going to pay you 100 bucks.
WATTERS: Do you ever watch "The Factor"?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sorry, pal. Forgive me.
WATTERS: What are you looking for in the new technology?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love the gadgets in the cars.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It has voice-activated text messaging.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It has an umbrella.
WATTERS: Very James Bond.
SEAN CONNERY, ACTOR: Bond, James Bond.
WATTERS: If I wanted it to shoot guns or missiles out of the headlights, could I do that?
It looks like back to the future.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. It's very futuristic.
MICHAEL J. FOX, ACTOR: You're telling me you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?
WATTERS: The Smart Car, what's so smart about it?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's small.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, what's the joke?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Easier to get around, to drive. Plus, as opposed to a Porsche, you don't have to worry about getting it scratched.
WATTERS: You don't have to worry about it getting stolen either.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That just happened!
WATTERS: Now, does it get good gas mileage?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Gas mileage is about 18 miles per gallon.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have four cars that do 40 miles to the gallon.
WATTERS: That's amazing.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is amazing.
WATTERS: Gas and electric and it's got a solar-powered roof booster.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
WATTERS: Pretend you're George Jetson, car of the future. What is it?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's all electric, so our reliance on foreign oil is absolutely slashed.
GEORGE O'HANLON, VOICE OF GEORGE JETSON: Someday, you're going to thank me for this.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's 100 percent electric.
WATTERS: It takes electricity to charge this?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A little slat pops up. You just plug it in.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You go to work, they'll have a station. You plug right in.
WATTERS: They don't have any stations now, though, do they?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not that I know of.
WATTERS: Now, does an electric car get you girls or not?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's pretty hot.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm going to get sick.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, gosh!
WATTERS: If a politician was to drive this car, who do you see driving a car like this?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This car could go both ways.
WATTERS: OK. It's bipartisan.
President Obama, what kind of car do you see him in?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please don't ask. I have no respect for the man.
WATTERS: Oh, wow. Ow.
STEVE CARRELL, ACTOR: What are you talking about?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think he would buy one of those Fiskers over there. It's just amazing to me that we're spending money on Solyndra and we're not getting an ounce of energy.
WATTERS: What kind of politician do you see in a car like this?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not a smart one.
TOM HANKS, ACTOR: I'm not a smart man.
WATTERS: Bill O'Reilly, would he like a car like this?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
You know how to drive a stick?
WATTERS: I don't. Does that make me less of a man?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We won't hold it against you.
WILL FERRELL, ACTOR: I'm not a baby; I'm a man!
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They don't make Crown Vics anymore. So maybe a Caddie.
WATTERS: Would O'Reilly drive a Leaf?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I wouldn't see why not. He can do top speeds up to 90 miles an hour.
WATTERS: That's not legal.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know how fast you were going?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sixty-five?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sixty-three.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: O'Reilly would probably own a K car to go from A to B. Because he's a basic guy.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I see him in a Jeep.
WATTERS: A Jeep?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's rugged, it's tough. It can take a hit, kind of like he can.
WATTERS: What kind of person drives the Lotus?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bill O'Reilly would be in a Lotus.
WATTERS: I don't know if that would fit Bill's price tag, though.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sure he'd find a way to get it to the right price. My way or the highway.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yee-haw!

VELEZ-MITCHELL: All right. And here is Jesse Watters.
What was the thing that impressed you the most inside the car that -- an option that we'll have in the next two or three years?
WATTERS: Well, the Geofence alert system in the Honda. So if you're out to the dinner, and you have the babysitter there watching the kids at home. And she takes your car and takes it beyond the prescribed range that you set, and she goes over to her boyfriend's house and has a little fun, you get an alert, a text message or an e-mail in your phone, saying she's going out of range and she's busted.
O'REILLY: All right. So you have the car on your property, and if somebody else drives it, you know where they're going.
WATTERS: Yes, your teenage son, the babysitter.
O'REILLY: What was this thing about texting verbally? They're going to build it into the dashboard? You'll be able to just press a button and say, "Da, da, da" and a text will go out?
WATTERS: Right. It's like KITT. Because everybody crashes when they try to text and drive at the same time.
O'REILLY: Yes. They die.
WATTERS: Right, they die.
O'REILLY: So that's not good.
WATTERS: So you can say -- you can say "XOXO," "LOL," and then it automatically sends it to someone's phone.
O'REILLY: Right. So it will have -- you'll have the ability to text and e-mail verbally in the car?
WATTERS: Yes, exactly.
O'REILLY: That's going to be big. People want that.
WATTERS: It's going to be amazing.
Now, the new technology, I think we're going to see is these electric cars, 100 percent electric.
O'REILLY: That's good. We like that.
WATTERS: So what you're going to do is you're going to have wireless charging, so instead of plugging it in, in a few years, you're going to be able to drive it in your garage. And it's just going to have a pad at the bottom. And you're going to hover it over the pad and charge it.
O'REILLY: Hover it over, and then it will charge it.
WATTERS: Yes, it will charge it.
O'REILLY: I'm for that.
WATTERS: You are?
O'REILLY: Get this thing up and running. But it's all 300,000 bucks they want for this stuff. But they've got to get it down for the regular folks.
All right, Watters. I appreciate it. Thank you, as always.
