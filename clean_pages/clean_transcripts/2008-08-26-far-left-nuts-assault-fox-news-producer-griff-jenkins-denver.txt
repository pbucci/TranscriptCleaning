BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "Personal Story" segment tonight: As we told you in the "Talking Points Memo," Barack Obama has to distance himself from the far-left loons, many of whom don't like Obama. He's too conservative for them.
Denver authorities were worried that thousands of these nuts would show up and cause damage to the city, but that has not happened, at least so far. Instead, hundreds of loons are on the streets.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is what a police state looks like.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What does a police state look like?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is what a police state looks like.
CROWD: Rise up with the people of the world. Rise up with the people of the world. Rise up with the people of the world.
CROWD: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) FOX News. (EXPLETIVE DELETED) FOX News. (EXPLETIVE DELETED) FOX News.
FORMER UNIV. OF COLORADO PROFESSOR WARD CHURCHILL: I was talking to somebody.
GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS PRODUCER: Hey, hold on, hold on. Let me ask you a question.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, we don't like you.
JENKINS: Answer the question.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't report the news accurately when it's talking about black and brown people.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do not believe Al Qaeda perpetrated the attacks on 9/11. 9/11 was an inside job.
CROWD: Bring the war home. Bring the war home.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's why we are out here: for the people in the hoods in Guantanamo who can't speak because they are shackled, because they are kept in cages.
CROWD: Whose streets?
CROWD: Our streets.

O'REILLY: With us now, FOX News producer Griff Jenkins, who has been keeping an eye on those people. And that applause is for you.
GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS PRODUCER: Why, thank you, Bill.
O'REILLY: Because you went out there. Now, that was Ward Churchill, right, we saw there?
JENKINS: It was.
O'REILLY: And the guy — and they put a sign up in front of the camera.
JENKINS: That was Ward Churchill, Bill. And what you've got is this Recreate '68 alliance. This is anything but Lincoln Park in 1968. This is a total bust. These are French protesters, many of them who weren't even born in 1968. And their goal to disrupt. Their official T-shirt, Bill, is black and it says "Defend Denver" with an AK-47 on it.
O'REILLY: So these are anarchists. They hate America. Did you ever feel in any danger out there with them?
JENKINS: Well, I did feel a little bit of danger. I felt they were reckless, Bill. In that one clip you saw was them pushing us around. My brave cameraman, Tom Yakman, and producer, David Legowitz, were trying to protect the camera. They were trying to destroy our camera.
And if you look personally at some of those clips on YouTube, a man is holding an infant less than a year old. And these guys have no regard for safety and really just want to cause chaos.
O'REILLY: Now, I know this is a hard question for you to quantify, but it looks like some of these people are violent, but you don't know how many, you know. You've always got that fringe of the fringe, which is why, you know, when we send our guys out, we usually have security and this, that, and the other thing with that.
But with the masks and everything, that was against the law in New York. Remember four years ago they tried that in New York, and they got arrested. But in Denver they're not arresting them when they have the masks on. Now in New York they did it under an anti-terrorist ordinance. You're not allowed to have a mask in public.
JENKINS: Right.
O'REILLY: But here the police seem more liberal, and they didn't really come to your defense. They were watching what was happening, I understand.
JENKINS: Well, that's right. But I think the difference here, Bill, is it's a much smaller group. And you do the — but you have a couple of hundred. The police were containing it. We went along the march. You know, at no point, other than the harassment they gave us — and, by the way, they have their articles of commandments, and their first one is protect free speech. You would have thought they would have been defending me in letting me get their story out.
O'REILLY: Now they don't like Barack Obama though. They're not big — they're not Obama supporters.
JENKINS: Not at all. Many of them called him a warmonger. And I thought...
O'REILLY: He's the warmonger?
JENKINS: ...wait, has anyone told him we're at the DNC? Barack Obama, one of the most liberal senators out there, he's for getting us out of Iraq. You know, I don't know who you go to. Hugo Chavez not available. Che Guevara's dead.
O'REILLY: Did you ever ask any of them, "Look, why are you doing this? This is just crazy"? Did you ever — were you able to pull one aside?
JENKINS: Absolutely. There were some people there, like Cindy Sheehan, that's trying to run against Nancy Pelosi. She has an anti-war message.
O'REILLY: Right.
JENKINS: But yes, guys like Ward Churchill. Here's a disgraced Colorado professor, who offended thousands of Americans, was fired for plagiarism. And here he is, showing up, and his goons are attacking me.
O'REILLY: He got his. There he is. No more University of Colorado for him.
All right, Griff. Stay safe out there. We'll check in with you again later this week.
