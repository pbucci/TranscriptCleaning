O'REILLY: Personal story segment tonight, actor Rob Lowe has a new book out called "Love Life." It's his second nonfiction tone, first one story as I always tell my friends was a big hit. While promoting the book Mr. Lowe said there is a Hollywood bias against good looking people. Since I wouldn't know. I have to ask Mr. Lowe himself. So here he is. Come on, Lowe. The reason you got the pictures in the first place is you were decent looking. You were just some guy in Ohio shoplifting. Come on.
ROB LOWE, ACTOR, AUTHOR & PRODUCER: It takes a journalist of your stature to bring this issue out of the shadows.
O'REILLY: Yes.
LOWE: And studies show worldwide at least 10 to 20 people a year are afflicted with good-looking bias.
O'REILLY: OK, so you are telling me that because you are a pretty boy you don't get the real gravitas parts that somebody like Daniel Day-Lewis would get. Is that what you are saying here?
LOWE: I am merely saying this that when they tell you you can't play the lead role of a PTA father because you don't look right.
O'REILLY: Yeah.
LOWE: When you are a PTA father you go, hmm, and then, when they say, but you know, what you would be great for? The rich jerk.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: But you would be great for that.
LOWE: Well, because I am a rich jerk. So, let's .
O'REILLY: All right, look, but I was watching - I watched these old movies on Turner classic movies. You know, Gable and Grant all those guys are very good-looking guys. And they got all the plumb parts.
LOWE: Right.
O'REILLY: Right.
LOWE: But it's changed now. You have to have angst now.
O'REILLY: And by the way, and maybe for the better - I love those guys, but guys who are my heroes like De Niro and Dustin Hoffman and Pacino would never have had that opportunity.
O'REILLY: And they are all ugly guys, they are not good looking people?
LOWE: They are charismatic.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: They are all .
(CROSSTALK)
LOWE: They are charismatic.
O'REILLY: All right, now, you also have said in your promoting this book that you want less government intrusion. Is that correct?
LOWE: I do.
O'REILLY: OK.
O'REILLY: Yeah. But your pinhead friends in Hollywood they don't want, they want, you know, equality for everyone, which take a massive government.
LOWE: I want equality for everybody is great.
O'REILLY: Yeah.
LOWE: That would be amazing. I just think that individuals usually do a better job than collective big government.
O'REILLY: So you don't want the government to be telling you how to live and how not. That's kind of a libertarian position.
LOWE: Well, that's funny, does that make me a libertarian? I mean .
O'REILLY: Well, that's a .
LOWE: I'm a Hollywood pinhead, Bill, I don't know about political labels.
O'REILLY: Yeah. The libertarians want less government and more personal freedom, which is I think what you are saying.
LOWE: But that is what I am saying.
O'REILLY: OK. So, now you're a libertarian.
LOWE: Since all this time shedding the dogma of political labels.
O'REILLY: Yeah.
LOWE: And now you are telling me I have to go back to living?
O'REILLY: No, no, no. But it's not bad. You just have to hang out with Stossel, which is really, really difficult.
LOWE: Forget it. Then I take it back. I'm not ..
O'REILLY: But that was, you know, I think, look, I'm not a libertarian but I don't think that the government can solve the problems that the government purports to be able to solve.
LOWE: Can we understand - just for the record we do need the government for a lot of big ticket items. And then - not total chore.
O'REILLY: We need the government to keep the transportation system running and to defend us against people like Putin.
LOWE: Yes.
O'REILLY: Doing helluva job on that, aren't they?
LOWE: And everyone is - and everyone ..
(LAUGHTER)
LOWE: He is he unbelievable.
O'REILLY: Putin?
LOWE: He's a boss.
O'REILLY: You should play Putin.
LOWE: I have the chest.
O'REILLY: Yeah, you can. Do you have the chest?
LOWE: I have the tax (ph).
O'REILLY: Yeah. And you wouldn't mind going topless every hour - on the hour.
LOWE: And I wouldn't mind shaving a little bit of my head either.
O'REILLY: OK.
LOWE: I can do it.
O'REILLY: Al right. Let's get their low playing Putin. Killing Putin.
LOWE: No, we can't do that.
O'REILLY: Oh yeah, that might be - might be coming up.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: All right. The book "Love Life" as I said your first book was very successful. Now, so say they buy, so we buy 20 bucks on "Love Life" here what are we going to learn that we didn't learn in the first book?
LOWE: Honestly that there were so many stories that I didn't want to put in the first book because, frankly, I thought they were a little too provocative. And if I put them in the first book I thought it would be all anyone talked about. So, once I got my confidence up as a writer really, I felt like I could tell some of them more .
O'REILLY: All right, so this goes a bit further than the first book. And it tells you .
LOWE: It tell you - it absolutely does.
O'REILLY: Right.
LOWE: But, also, I wanted it to one hand be provocative and say things that I didn't have the guts to say in the first one. But I also want it to be more personal about raising two teenage boys and all that crazy .
O'REILLY: And I read the book. And it's a good book. Like I say, Lowe puts together a fast read.
LOWE: Wait, wait, wait. This is amazing. We've got a good review .
O'REILLY: I'm not blurbing you.
LOWE: You don't - you don't give it up.
O'REILLY: I can't use that.
LOWE: You don't give it up.
O'REILLY: It's a fast read. It's good. But I got one more question and then I will let you go. I want to do the beard stubble thing. Should I do that? Is that - is that hard to do.
LOWE: I want you to know that today I woke up and was ready to - honestly, I was lather .
O'REILLY: This is O'Reilly and I'm not shaving.
LOWE: I said I'm on O'Reilly and I know how much he hates it, I'm keeping it.
O'REILLY: Right. Yeah. You know, I'm not putting a tie. I'm not going to get the stubble going on.
LOWE: I knew.
O'REILLY: You took a shower though, didn't you?
LOWE: I did do that. And I wore a vest.
O'REILLY: And you wore a vest. That's because you are a pretty boy. That's what pretty boys do.
LOWE: That's what we do.
