This is a rush transcript from "The O'Reilly Factor," October 20, 2008. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "Back of the Book" segment tonight: "Reality Check," where the truth sometimes hurts. And that will be the case for every person who hurt you and your family in this financial meltdown fraud. We're tracking them down one by one.
"Check" one: Former CEO of Merrill Lynch, Stanley O'Neal, allowed that company to buy up bad mortgages, ruining the franchise. The Bank of America had to buy Merrill to keep it afloat.
Even though untold thousands of folks lost billions on Merrill stock, reports say O'Neal was given more than $150 million when he was tossed out. That is a complete disgrace, corrupt and un-American.
O'Neal would not come on "The Factor," so Jesse Watters went to him.

JESSE WATTERS, "FACTOR" PRODUCER: Hey, Stan, Jesse Watters with FOX News. How are you? Millions of people lost millions of dollars at Merrill Lynch. You pulled a lot of money out there and didn't do a very good job. How do you feel about that?
You know a lot of people trusted you. Mr. O'Neal, you don't have anything to say? You had $161.5 million golden parachute. You don't have anything to say to any of the shareholders or any of the investors, any of the employees? To the rest of the country?
Do you feel bad about what happened at all?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Of course not. O'Neal maintains lavish homes in Westchester County, New York City and other places. He should be very ashamed. Did he look ashamed?
"Check" two: Out on the campaign trail, Sarah Palin and Joe Biden saw things a bit differently.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SARAH PALIN, GOP VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We believe that the best of America is in these small towns that we get to visit, and in these wonderful little pockets of what I call real America, being here with all of you hardworking, very patriotic, very pro-American areas of this great nation.
JOE BIDEN, DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We're all patriotic. We all love our country, in every part of this nation. And I am tired, I am tired, tired, tired, tired of the implication about patriotism.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Well, we don't all love America. We aren't all patriotic. Not for a second.
"Check" three: After Joe the plumber became a campaign issue, the NBC News reporters — correspondents, not commentators — went to town.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAVID GREGORY, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: A couple things about Joe. His first name is actually Samuel. Joseph is his middle name. He doesn't have a plumbing license, although he claims he doesn't need it when he works for other people in Ohio. And he's been described as being undecided, but he is a registered Republican who voted in the GOP primary this year.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bloomberg News is reporting that Joe the plumber owes more than $1,000 in back taxes. There's a report that he doesn't have the proper license.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Now, in response to that, here's what Laura Ingraham said on "The Factor" on Friday.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: NBC had a satellite truck parked outside Joe the plumber's house yesterday. I have a question. Did it ever, a single day, did it ever send a truck and a reporter to the still-defiant terrorist Bill Ayers house? Has NBC ever really dug into the nature of Obama's relationship with ACORN, now the subject of a FBI investigation in 12 states? You know the answer: N-O.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: "Check" could not have said it better.
"Check" four: The FOX program "Family Guy" is run by a notorious left-winger named Seth MacFarlane who often uses the program to promote his causes.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, fellows, do you want to get a free caricature?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I want to be a skateboarder.
SETH MACFARLANE, VOICE ACTOR: There's something on here.
(CLOSE-UP OF MCCAIN-PALIN PIN ON NAZI UNIFORM)
MACFARLANE: That's weird.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Nice, right? "Family Guy," sure.
"Check" five: A nice review on NewsMax.com of my book, "A Bold Fresh Piece of Humanity." Phil Brennan, the reviewer, actually read the book, and I appreciate what he wrote about it.
Also, "Check" wants to thank Borders for its great promotion of "Bold Fresh." In November we are putting together a signing at the Borders in Providence, Rhode Island. We'll tell you when and where. Well, it's the Borders in Providence, Rhode Island. We'll tell you when.
In December we'll have a signing at the Barnes & Noble out in Smithtown, Long Island, New York. The book's going great.
We congratulate Kay Mundell, who lives in Fort Cobb, Oklahoma. She correctly answered the "Bold Fresh" quiz question that I painted houses to help pay for some college expenses. Kay wins the nifty "No Pinheads" mat.
The new "Bold Fresh" question: What movie scared the daylights out of me as a kid? What movie scared me as a kid? Go to BillOReilly.com with the answer. I hope you win the mat.
That is "Reality Check."
