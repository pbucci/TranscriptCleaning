By Bill O'Reilly
Hi, I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight. Al Sharpton and the grievous industry strike back -- that is the subject of this evening's "Talking Points Memo".
Last week, we told you that one of the big reasons Trayvon Martin lost his life was that George Zimmerman feared the image he projected that night in Florida -- his clothing, his presence. Zimmerman profiled Martin and disaster followed. The anger this case has engendered was understandable. If Trayvon Martin was my son I would be doing exactly what his parents are doing.
But out of tragedy can come something positive and that is why "Talking Points" is urging the civil rights folks to stop maligning the country and face up to a huge problem that is directly harming millions, primarily in the African-American community. Young black Americans are the most violent group in this country by far.
The reason is the collapse of the traditional African-American family unit; 50 years ago when blacks had it much worse than they had it now 25 percent of black babies were born out of wedlock, today the number is close to 75 percent. That is catastrophic. But the civil rights industry and the white power fracture basically ignore the problem. They also ignore the entertainment industry putting out vile products aimed at young people, some of whom incorporate the gangster culture into their own lives.
On Thursday we told you that Al Sharpton, now in business with a company that distributes garbage like Lil' Wayne, while Sharpton says he's concerned with the state of black culture, his upcoming book will be marketed by a company, Cash Money Content, that debases this country.
In response to my analysis, Sharpton took to the air and did what he usually does. He attacked the messenger implying that I am racist.

SHARPTON: Why is Bill O'Reilly talking about the African-American family? It's hard to take much of this race talk seriously. I took Bill to Silvia's Restaurant in Harlem for dinner in 2007. Here is how he described it afterward.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
O'REILLY: There wasn't one person in Sylvia's who was screaming "M- fer. I want more ice tea."
SHARPTON: Please.
O'REILLY: You know I mean everybody was -- it was like going into an Italian restaurant in an all-white suburb in the sense of people were sitting there and they were ordering and having fun and there wasn't any kind of craziness at all.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Well that sounds kind of patronizing, right? What Sharpton and a number of others on MSNBC did was take the radio clip from 2007 completely out of context. Here was my set up to the Sylvia's comment, something that dishonest Sharpton would never run.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Black people in this country understand that they have had a very, very tough go of it. And some of them can get past that and some of them cannot. I don't think there is a black American who hasn't had a personal insult that they have had to deal with because of the color of their skin. I don't think there is one in the country. So you've got to accept that as being the truth.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Does that sound anti-black to you? I continued my theme that despite racial injustice in the past, we're all Americans with much in common and the marketplace is now reflecting that. I illustrated that point by talking about my dinner with Sharpton at Sylvia's restaurant.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
O'REILLY: You know when Sharpton and I walked in it was like a big commotion and everything but everybody was very nice. And I couldn't get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia's restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean it was -- it was exactly the same. Even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship, it was the same. And that's really what the society is all about now here in the USA. There is no difference. There is no difference.
O'REILLY: Quite a different tone. Sharpton and others are attacking me because I am a threat to them. They have failed, failed to deal effectively with problems in the black community and they make a lot of money by promoting racial division.
Huffing indignant Sharpton wrapped up his assault on me this way.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SHARPTON: We don't just want to single out one person but we do want to set the record straight and we are not going to allow them to decide the conversation that we're going to have in this country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: So who is we, Al? Who is we? Who is them? Talking Points believes the day of the race hustlers is coming to an end. This we and them business gets the country nowhere. Fair-minded Americans well understand there are severe problems in the black community that have to be solved. And it will take honest, courageous people to do that. One of those honest people, CNN Anchor Don Lemon, who referenced my "Talking Points" on his program.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: He's got a point. In fact, he's got more than a point -- Bill.
O'REILLY: Race without much structure young black men often reject education and gravitate towards the street culture, drugs, hustling, gangs. Nobody forces them to do that. Again, it is a personal decision.
LEMON: He is right about that, too. But, in my estimation, he doesn't go far enough.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Mr. Lemon then went on to list things that African- Americans should do to combat social problems. After his remarks, Mr. Lemon was predictably attacked by the race hustlers. But his courage stands in stark contrast to their ignorance and corruption. As for Al Sharpton, we will leave with him saying this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SHARPTON: Is Bill O'Reilly saying George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin because Trayvon was born out of wedlock even though he wasn't? That's ridiculous, right?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Ridiculous, you bet, Al. Your day is done.
