BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "Personal Story" segment tonight: the dumbest things of the year.
Now, we have spent many, many hours, ladies and gentlemen, selecting five of the most moronic things uttered this year, 2010. Here now to help us out, "Red Eye" guy Greg Gutfeld and Fox News correspondent Arthel Neville.
Now, we start with No. 5. Say hello to my little friend, Nancy Pelosi.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., OUTGOING SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: The final health care legislation that will soon be passed will deliver successful reform at the local level, but we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

O'REILLY: You've got to pass it to find out what's in it, away from the fog.
ARTHEL NEVILLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Not good, not good, not good. That did sound dumb. Of course, I'm not against health care overall. I want to say that that is not dumb overall. But look, everybody was confused, up in arms. And you can't have the speaker of the House saying, "Well, we're not sure what's in it but just pass it along."

O'REILLY: Now you say you're not against the health care bill.

NEVILLE: No, I'm not.
O'REILLY: Have you read the bill?
NEVILLE: I have not read it. It's a big bill. They haven't either.
O'REILLY: I don't know if you want to go out on that limb if you haven't read it.
NEVILLE: All I'm saying...
O'REILLY: That might be a dumb statement.
NEVILLE: All I'm saying, there are a couple good things in it.
O'REILLY: A couple of good -- and I said that from the jump.
NEVILLE: Kids can stay on their parent's policy until 26.

O'REILLY: I've said that from the jump, a couple good things.

NEVILLE: You have fewer disparities for folks who can't normally afford health care.
O'REILLY: But if it bankrupts the nation, it is a Pyrrhic victory.

NEVILLE: You know, I'm not here to debate the bill.
O'REILLY: No, I know, but I'm saying that if you support the bill, you know...
NEVILLE: I'm not here to go nose to nose for it. I'm just saying that overall, I don't think it's bad.

GREG GUTFELD, HOST, "RED EYE": I don't know. Every time she speaks I just keep waiting for a house to land on her.

O'REILLY: Are you talking about Arthel or Pelosi?

GUTFELD: Pelosi.

NEVILLE: You're not funny, O'Reilly.

O'REILLY: I know I'm not. I'm delirious. That's what I am.

NEVILLE: You're delusional is what you are.
O'REILLY: All right. Here is No. 4. This pinhead kills me. Former BP CEO Tony Hayward responding to the oil spill.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TONY HAYWARD, FORMER BP CEO: We're sorry for the massive disruption it's caused their lives. And you know, we're -- there's no one who wants this thing over more than I do. You know, I'd like my life back.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

O'REILLY: That's right, Tony. It's all about you, isn't it? Not about the pelicans covered with oil.

GUTFELD: This is like if you're walking across the street and get hit by a cab, and the cab driver says, "Look at the blood on my fender."

NEVILLE: What's even dumber about this is this guy walks around with $17 million in severance pension.
O'REILLY: That's dumb. That's dumb and that's BP. But he also then went on his yacht as soon as they yank him off.

GUTFELD: By the way, he -- I've got to defend him. He did go through a lot of stress.

O'REILLY: Yes, I know.
GUTFELD: He really did.

O'REILLY: OK. I think we should -- no, I'm not going to say it.
All right. Here is No. 3. Sharron Angle, who lost her Senate race against Harry Reid in Nevada, said this when addressing 150 Hispanic high school students.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SHARRON ANGLE, R-NEV., FORMER SENATE CANDIDATE: I don't know that all of you are Latino. Some of you look a little more Asian to me. I don't know that. What we know about -- what we know about ourselves is that we are a melting pot in this country. My -- my grandchildren are evidence of that. I'm evidence of that. I've been called the third Asian legislator in our Nevada state assembly.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

O'REILLY: Right after that, Ms. Angle's campaign began melting.

NEVILLE: Yes.

O'REILLY: Melting pot. Most Hispanics in the state voted against her, so I think that speaks for itself.
NEVILLE: Yes. You can't say much more about that.

O'REILLY: Yes.
NEVILLE: It was not good.

GUTFELD: So the Tea Party was like a tidal wave and with the tidal wave you get some seaweed.

O'REILLY: She was on this program, and she is not a dumb woman. That was just a big, big...

NEVILLE: Big, big mistake.

O'REILLY: ...mistake, and it was dumb.
All right. No. 2. The second dumbest statement of the year, ladies and gentlemen: the attorney general of the United States.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you read the Arizona law?
ERIC HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL: I have not had a chance. I've glanced at it. I have not read it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's 10 pages. It's a lot shorter than the health care bill, which was 2,000 pages long. I'll give you my copy of it if you would like to have a copy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

O'REILLY: So despite not having read the Arizona law, Holder decided to sue the state.
NEVILLE: That was not a good moment for the attorney general.
O'REILLY: Very astute, Ms. Neville. That was...

NEVILLE: Excuse me, can I slap him?
GUTFELD: No.
O'REILLY: She can't reach. That's why I'm sitting over here.

GUTFELD: You can slap me though because I enjoy it.

NEVILLE: You know, some might say, with all due respect to Mr. Holder, some might say that he was getting advice from Lloyd and Harry. Do you know who they are?
GUTFELD: Yes. "Dumb and Dumber."
O'REILLY: That's the movie, right? Daniels and who was the other guy?
NEVILLE: Jim Carrey.
O'REILLY: OK.

GUTFELD: Which proves one point: You don't have to read anything as long as you call something racist.
O'REILLY: Yes.
GUTFELD: That's what he did. It saves time.

O'REILLY: But -- but he gets up there, and he's the guy, he's the face of the lawsuit. He's the guy, all right?

GUTFELD: He also jumped the gun with Gitmo.
O'REILLY: It's a 10-page law, and he didn't read it. Now, Pelosi, 2,000 pages.
NEVILLE: Which is why I haven't read the health care bill.

O'REILLY: You put yourself out on that little limb there, boy, I'm going to cut you off unless you do your research.
NEVILLE: The three things I pointed out, I stand by.
O'REILLY: OK. I'm glad she stands by.
Here is, ladies and gentlemen, the dumbest statement of the year, which actually was made in late 2009. But it's so dumb that we had to carry it over. Alan Grayson, simply have to give him the award. Go.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ALAN GRAYSON, D-FLA.: The Republicans' health care plan for America, don't get sick. If you get sick, America, the Republican health care plan is this. Die quickly. That's right. The Republicans want you to die quickly if you get sick.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

O'REILLY: Ironically, Alan Grayson's job died very quickly. He was voted out after one term in November. So, you know, I hate to be predictable here, but I think we picked five pretty good ones.
NEVILLE: I think so.
GUTFELD: I don't know. I would rather die quickly than suffer. Don't you think he's right? I think it's good.
O'REILLY: Let me ask you something, with all due respect. Are you trying to top Grayson here?
GUTFELD: Yes.
NEVILLE: I think he was. No, I've got to tell you, I was actually trying to help you out, but I came up with nothing.
O'REILLY: No. Now Grayson voted out, even in a liberal district in Florida, primarily because of his dumb statements.
NEVILLE: Histrionics don't work...
O'REILLY: Right.
NEVILLE: ...on the House floor all the time. Maybe in the courtroom.
O'REILLY: And so there is a price to pay. You get mocked on this broadcast, but you also lose your job.
All right. Very good, you guys. We appreciate it.
