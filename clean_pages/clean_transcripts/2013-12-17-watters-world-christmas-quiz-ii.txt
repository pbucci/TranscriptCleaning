O'REILLY: In "Back of the Book" segment tonight, "Watters' World," the Christmas edition. As you may know, the federal holiday falls on Wednesday, December 25th this year. All federal employees are off but get paid.
Also, a new Rasmussen poll says most Americans strongly believe Christmas should be a part of the public school landscape, 75 percent of American adults want that to happen, just 15 percent disagree, 10 percent don't know what Christmas is.

So, we sent Jesse Watters out to talk to the folks about Christmas.

O'REILLY: All right, here he is. Now, it seemed like everybody was kind of cooperative again.
WATTERS: Yes, yes, cooperative.
O'REILLY: Nobody fled.
WATTERS: No one fled, except me.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: Well, you got attacked by the pigeon.
WATTERS: I did.
O'REILLY: And why, why.
WATTERS: He was lucky, I didn't connect there.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
I had a little power in that --
O'REILLY: Why. You would have been arrested and Peter would have come and --
WATTERS: I know he would have come. No, I am afraid of pigeons. I don't like them.
O'REILLY: Well, that's your problem.
(LAUGHTER)
Why did they attack. Why did they attack. Why are they on this guy's head.
WATTERS: The guy was feeding pigeons with crumbs.
O'REILLY: Oh, he's feeding.
WATTERS: And they were so comfortable, they perched on his shoulder.
O'REILLY: Right. He's feeding them.
WATTERS: And I think they're like flying rats.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
So, I don't want to make time for them.
O'REILLY: Like some Woody Allen line. I thought that was Mike Tyson. He's a big pigeon guy, too.
(LAUGHTER)
Now, people write me letters. They all, "Look, Watters is looking for the dumbest people. That's who he's out looking." Do you have a big sign, "If you're dumb, please talk to me."
WATTERS: I am attracted to dumb people.
(LAUGHTER)
There's this natural attraction there. I seek them out. Sometimes, I find out. But we do have --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
-- fair piece. I just happened to me in Washington Square Park.
O'REILLY: OK. Tell the audience -- tell the audience what the "Watters' World" selection process is.
WATTERS: Oh, this is --
O'REILLY: Who gets on.
WATTERS: -- this is secret, Bill. This is the secret sauce here.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Oh, this is like secret sauce.
WATTERS: It's a lot of instinct. OK, I look for personality.
O'REILLY: Right.
WATTERS: OK. I look for looks and I look for someone that's a good talked.
O'REILLY: Do you have auditions. Do they have to do a dance.
WATTERS: In my mind, OK.
O'REILLY: All right.
WATTERS: No, you know, I'll either look --
O'REILLY: So, before the camera goes on, --
WATTERS: -- for someone with a crazy hair, someone with the good looks.
O'REILLY: Wait, wait. So, before the camera goes on, you ask them a few questions just to see what they're like.
WATTERS: No, not at all.
O'REILLY: No, you go cold?
WATTERS: We start right away.
O'REILLY: OK.
WATTERS: And then if they're bad, I just bail immediately.
O'REILLY: OK.
WATTERS: But if they're good, we warm up.
O'REILLY: You ask permission before you can talk -- before you talk to them.
WATTERS: Well, I say, you know, "I'm Jesse from THE FACTOR. I want to talk to you about Christmas."
O'REILLY: And then they say another thing.
WATTERS: And then we go.
O'REILLY: All right. I think you got "Watters' World." And if you're a pigeon, get him.
WATTERS: No, please no.
