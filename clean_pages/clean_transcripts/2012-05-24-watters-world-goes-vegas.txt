ROBIN LEACH, TV PERSONALITY: You've got to know a little bit about this city, because it really is a tale of two cities, as Charles Dickens once wrote.
JESSE WATTERS, "FACTOR" PRODUCER: What are you guys doing in Vegas?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go to some clubs maybe tonight, Thursday night, Friday night,and Saturday night.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I like this guy.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Having a little me time.
WATTERS: Now, what does "me time" mean?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Me time is doing some shopping.
WATTERS: Shopping?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shopping and more shopping.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We actually came out for a girls' weekend.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm partying. I'm having a great time.
WATTERS: You looked stressed.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to do Saturday night (UNINTELLIGIBLE) taco.
WATTERS: What?
WATTERS: What about gambling?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not a big gambler. I do actually drop in a couple quarters in the slot.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just hope you had better luck than I had.
WATTERS: Are you guys doing gambling?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't like throwing my money away.
WATTERS: So what do you play on each hand?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 100 or 2.
WATTERS: What clubs are you going to?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Strip clubs.
JEREMY PIVEN, ACTOR: He's got some fire to him. I like that.
WATTERS: How much are you guys spending on the room at the Venetian?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I -- a grand.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I tend to give myself around 4 or 500 for fun.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I said 125 zero dollars (ph).
CHRIS TUCKER, ACTOR: Do you speak-a any English?
WATTERS: Do you feel weird dropping 400 bucks on a bottle of liquor?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When there is 10 girls make you feel a little bit better.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Excuse me, can I have a glass of alcohol?
WATTERS: When you go out to a restaurant, what are you spending on a nice meal?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Usually around 100.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're spending $500 a night.
WATTERS: What kind of tip do you leave?
DON RICKLES, COMEDIAN: Don't tell me, let me guess.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Twenty-five percent.
JOHN WAYNE, ACTOR: I like the way you said that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A $10,000 tip.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shut your mouth when you're talking to me!
WATTERS: Doing a lot of drinking out here?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Got to keep your wit around here. Characters, you know.
WATTERS: Like that guy right there.
Times are tough?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm Tom Cruise.
WATTERS: You're Tom Cruise?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
WATTERS: I like "Mission: Impossible."
TOM CRUISE, ACTOR: What?
WATTERS: Are you a 1 percenter?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What does that mean exactly?
FRANKIE AVALON, ACTOR: What?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I employ over a thousand people. The American dream.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because of the economy we're having, to have a person come in and spend 4 or $500 on a bottle of wine. Probably spend a buck 75.
ROBERT DE NIRO, ACTOR: That's how serious it is.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When Obama mentioned about the industry, it's not the place to be, it died for three or four years.
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When times are tough, don't blow a bunch of cash on Vegas.
WATTERS: How do you think things are going?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think we need a change in presidency.
WATTERS: I thought we were supposed to have change.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For sure.
WATTERS: Do you ever watch "The O'Reilly Factor."
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love bill.
WATTERS: You do?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I do. He's so honest, and he has those pithy words. I just love him.
O'REILLY: Do not be a jackanapes.
Watters: What's your favorite part of the show?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've never watched it. I'm sorry.
JAMES CARREY, ACTOR: I can't lie.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My grandpa said for his 83rd birthday that he wants a copy of "Killing Lincoln."
WATTERS: All right. We'll see if we can make that happen.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sounds good.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've been to (UNINTELLIGIBLE)
WATTERS: Where haven't you been?
(END VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: All right. So when you were there, there was a lot of commerce, right?
WATTERS: Yes.
O'REILLY: Clubs filled? The casinos filled? People running around?
WATTERS: Right.
O'REILLY: But Leach at the top of the piece says a tale of two cities.
WATTERS: Right.
O'REILLY: And Vegas has more unemployment than most cities, more than 11 percent. So who's not working?
WATTERS: Well, here it is. There's about a half a million population in Vegas. But 40 million people visit Vegas each year. So it's a trickle down economic situation.
Conservative tycoons run the strip. You have Sheldon Adelson, Steve Wynn. And they compete to see who can build bigger fiefdoms there.
O'REILLY: Aren't they hiring people? Like, if you go to Vegas and can't you get a job there? Don't they need service people there?
WATTERS: Well, they're tightening things up. In a way, it's kind of like a jobless recovery that people are talking about.
O'REILLY: Not hiring?
WATTERS: Well, they're hiring, but it's not like, you know, big-time jobs. You're getting small jobs. Menial labor, a lot of illegal immigrants. We saw a lot of illegal immigrants on the street, passing out strip club cards, people doing menial labor. Those kind of things.
O'REILLY: OK. So it is the people who come bring money.
WATTERS: Right.
O'REILLY: The people who live there don't have any right now.
WATTERS: They don't have a lot. But it's on the way back. I don't want to sell out Vegas. They're coming back.
O'REILLY: All right. Jesse Watters, everybody.
