Bush versus Kerry on terrorism, that is the subject of this evening's "Talking Points Memo."  President Bush talked with Sean Hannity —  That interview will be next on "Hannity & Colmes."  And one of his statements is causing some controversy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The 9/11 Commission reports that America is safer under the course of action we've taken but not yet safe.  Whether or not we can be ever fully safe is up - you know, is up in the air.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Now you may remember Mr. Bush said almost the same thing on "The Today Show," and it's true.  Nobody can predict whether America can fully defeat  terrorism.  Wait a minute.  Nobody except John Kerry.

SEN. JOHN KERRY (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Now there's a whole new interview.  And the president says in this interview "whether or not we can be fully safe looking out to the future is up in the air."
Well, let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen.  You make me president of the United States, we're going to win the war on terror.  It's not going to be up in the air whether or not we make America safe.

Wow, that's a pretty bold statement, isn't it?  But it may be just politics as usual.  Let's analyze it: Terrorists exist all over the world.  We all know that, with Islamic fascists being the most treacherous.  Since the world will not unite against terrorism, no single country can wipe the menace out.  Worldwide cooperation is needed to do that.
Now Senator Kerry believes he can better mobilize foreign nations to engage the war on terror.  He really, really believes that.  But it's a hope, not a reality.  And so is the Senator saying that if president, he will defeat the terrorists.  It is simply a hope.
And that's "The Memo."
The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day
Our pal Cher, I should say, is on the campaign trail, kind of.  Speaking in South Florida for Senator Kerry, Cher said this.

CHER, ENTERTAINER:  All the gay guys, all my friends, all my gay friends, you guys, you have got to vote, all right, because it will only be a matter of time before you guys will be so screwed, I cannot tell you, because, you know, the people like in the very right wing of this party of these Republicans, the very, very right wing, the Jerry Falwell element, you know, if they get any more power, you guys will be living in some state, you know, by yourselves.

We wonder what state that would be, but to speculate would be ridiculous.
Cher.  I love Cher.  I think the botox is going — no, no.
