Obama to me, is an aloof salesman who is not even sold on his
own product. He is selling used Pintos but he really wants to push Jaguars for
him. It's hard to lead when you dislike the very thing you lead when you're
embarrassed. We need to admit this sobering fact. He is just not that into us,
the U.S. that is. Was he ever?
Let's face it, we aren't cool enough, we aren't progressive
enough. We don't like the same music. We hate ObamaCare. We don't watch
Frontline with Clooney. We are the clumsy oaf responsible for all that's wrong
with the world. And he hates that it hurts his popularity. It is why he hates
these press conferences. He's thinking, "Do I really need to talk to these
people?" He wants to roll with a better crowd.
And I'm perfectly fine with him seeing other people, if it
gets him out of the house more.
And that's "The Memo."
