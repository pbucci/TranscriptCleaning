All the polling indicates Republicans will do very well next Tuesday, as millions of Americans are angry about the economy and the general direction of the country.

A new Gallup poll says that 63 percent of Republicans say they are enthusiastic to vote. Just 37 percent of Democrats say they are jazzed to go to the polls. That's huge because a low turnout among Democrats will doom the party this time around.

On Tuesday, there was some new polling. According to Quinnipiac, John Kasich is now six points ahead of Ted Strickland in the Ohio governor's race. In the Ohio Senate race, Republican Rob Portman is leading Democrat Lee Fischer by 17 points. So Mr. Portman is a lock.

In West Virginia, it's close. According to a new Fox News poll, Republican John Raese leads Democrat Joe Manchin by just two points in the Senate race there.

In Connecticut, it's not so close. Democrat Dick Blumenthal is well ahead of Republican Linda McMahon.

In Illinois, the race for Barack Obama's old Senate seat has Republican Mark Kirk ahead of Alexi Giannoulias by two points according to the Fox poll.

In California, Sen. Barbara Boxer leads Carly Fiorina by four points, and Jerry Brown is running well ahead of his challenger, Republican Meg Whitman.

In Kentucky, Rand Paul seems to be pulling away from Democrat Jack Conway in that Senate contest.

Perhaps the most intense race in the country is in Nevada between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and challenger Sharron Angle, who leads Reid by four points according to Rasmussen.

That is driving the far left nuts. On Tuesday, Joy Behar said this about a criminal illegal alien ad Ms. Angle released:

JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": This is a moron on top of being evil. I would like to see her do this ad in the south Bronx. Come here (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Come to New York and do it.

SHERRI SHEPHERD, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": And we're praying for you. We are praying for you.

ELISABETH HASSELBECK, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Even Joy is praying for you.

BEHAR: I 'm not praying for her.

SHEPHERD: I 'm praying for everybody.

BEHAR: She is going to hell, this (EXPLETIVE DELETED).

That kind of rhetoric, of course, helps Sharron Angle.

"Talking Points" is an independent voter, but I do believe the country is on the wrong track. President Obama has made a calculated gamble with massive spending, and it has not translated into more jobs. Americans understand that simple equation.

They also understand that under the Democratic leadership, the nation has added an amazing $5 trillion in debt. Obviously that has to stop, and the folks know it.

And that's "The Memo."

Pinheads & Patriots


We knew it would happen. We knew "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" would weigh in on the NPR-Juan Williams fiasco:

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANALYST: When I get on a plane, I've got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb, and I think, you know, they're identifying themselves first and foremost as Muslims, I get worried. I get nervous.

JON STEWART, HOST, "THE DAILY SHOW": That's it? That's what got him fired?

SAMANTHA BEE, CORRESPONDENT, "THE DAILY SHOW": Yes. It was a direct violation of NPR's "never say anything interesting" policy.

STEWART: NPR, you just brought a tote bag full of David Sedaris books to a knife fight. I'm sure NPR can mount a vigorous counterattack.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This hour, the Juan Williams controversy. October, when the green of summer gives way to the autumnal cavalcade of colorful foliage. It was then that Juan Williams was informed by NPR executives that his contract had been terminated.

Is Mr. Stewart a pinhead or patriot for that exposition? Please vote on BillOReilly.com.

Monday night we showed you George Clooney, generally a liberal guy, praising conservatives for supporting his campaign against the atrocities in Darfur. Seventy percent of "The Factor" audience said Mr. Clooney was a patriot for doing that; 30 percent believe he remains a pinhead.
