O'REILLY: In "Back of the Book" segment tonight, "Watters' World." You may remember a couple of years ago, Brown University in Rhode Island used student activity fees to partially fund a sex exposition.
Jesse Watters went up there to ask about it and was not greeted with enthusiasm. So, when we heard that Brown was sponsoring a Clothing Optional Week, we asked Watters to man up and go back to Brown.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
WATTERS: So, what is the meaning of Nudity Week.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 1: I think it's just providing a comfortable space for people to express themselves.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 2: You know, gender expression, gender performativity.
WATTERS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's gender performativity.
(LAUGHTER)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DUSTIN HOFFMAN, ACTOR: This conversation is getting a little strange.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 1: Really, some of the kids here are really into being naked with each other.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 2: That's a good way for students to feel comfortable with their bodies.
WATTERS: Did you guys think that this is just a ruse to see your classmates nude.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 3: No, there are other ways to just see your classmates nude.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 4: Women feeling bad about their weight, men feeling bad about their weight. I think --
WATTERS: I feel bad about my weight sometimes.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 4: So, do I, Jesse.
WATTERS: You don't need to though.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 5: We allow people to sort of do whatever they want, whatever they feel to further their best interest.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 2: Like if the whole thing was violence in the media, people are OK with that. But if you show one nipple, everyone goes crazy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL MURRAY, ACTOR: Dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 6: I don't need any extra nudity in my life.
WATTERS: OK, you have just enough nudity in your life right now.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 6: Yes.
WATTERS: You don't need any more nudity.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 6: No.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 1: During exam week, we have like the Naked Doughnut Run.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 4: What's your angle of this story.
WATTERS: If there's a naked event on a college campus, I want to know about it.
A lot of students are doing nude yoga, nude body painting.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 3: A lot of students are playing poker. What's the educational value of that.
WATTERS: Well, Mathematics.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: You, guys, playing cards?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Now, nude body painting. Is that finger painting or is it a roller.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 2: I'm not really sure but I assume it can be any of these things.
WATTERS: Were you a painter or were you a paintee.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 7: I was both the artist and the canvass.
WATTERS: Did it tickle.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 7: I wasn't uncomfortable at all.
WATTERS: Nude yoga. Sounds like a little bit of a stretch. Do you bring your own mat.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 8: No, they provide mats and you bring a towel.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHEVY CHASE, ACTOR: Can I borrow your towel for a sec. My car just hit a water buffalo.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 2: It was actually like a really spiritual experience.
WATTERS: Was it hard.
Now, what about nude theater.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 1: What about it.
WATTERS: Are there puppets or something.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 4: To step on stage and say, "This is my body. It's OK to look."
WATTERS: Was your nude scene really small.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 4: No, it was significant.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: So huge!
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: Thanks.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: How much money do you pay to go to Brown about.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 2: Between 50 and 60,000.
WATTERS: Let's call your mom right now and tell her it's Nudity Week here at Brown.
This is Jesse Watters with the O'REILLY FACTOR. How are you doing, mom.
MOTHER OF A STUDENT (on the phone): OK.
WATTERS: Did you know that it's Nudity Week at Brown here, mom.
MOTHER OF A STUDENT: OK.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: What, what, what!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Do your parents know that you participated in nude body painting at school.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 7: They do now.
WATTERS: Say hi to dad.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 7: Hey, daddy.
WATTERS: Do you ever watch the O'REILLY FACTOR on Fox News.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 8: No, I don't. I don't know what that is.
WATTERS: Shame on you.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 8: I'm English.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE MYERS: Actually, I'm English.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: Sorry.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 5: I have never watched the show on principle.
WATTERS: So, you've never watched the show but you disagree with everything he says. But you don't know what he said because you've never watched him.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 5: I -- I think I really just want to leave it at that.
MOTHER OF A STUDENT (on the phone): I love Bill O'Reilly.
WATTERS: Do you watch "Watters' World."
MOTHER OF A STUDENT: Yes, I do.
WATTERS: This is Jesse Watters.
MOTHER OF A STUDENT: OK, well, great.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: All right. Now, you've got a lot of heat, you going up there and then --
WATTERS: Yes, it was a little testy.
O'REILLY: And that newspaper attacked you?
WATTERS: Yes, they attacked me. That's right. I actually got kicked off campus --
O'REILLY: By who.
WATTERS: -- by the administrator, so I had to leave and go out immediately.
O'REILLY: Why did they kick you off campus.
WATTERS: Well, I guess you're not allowed to film everywhere. And I really want to dive deep into Nudity Week, so --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: So, they wouldn't let you film the actual event.
WATTERS: I went too far.
O'REILLY: That's just as well. What did the newspaper say. I mean, you know, college newspapers -- I was on -- I don't know whether you were on on yours but I was on the "Boston University Daily Free Press." They kind of like to mix it up a little bit.
WATTERS: Yes.
O'REILLY: If they don't like you --
WATTERS: No. And they were very angry with me. Tonight, they've organized a drinking game.
So, every time I make fun of them tonight, they're going to drink.
O'REILLY: Uh-huh.
WATTERS: So, they're probably hammered right now.
O'REILLY: Are they clothed.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: I have no idea. I don't need to know that.
O'REILLY: But the week ended, right.
WATTERS: I think it's over but I mean --
O'REILLY: It's getting cold up there in Rhode Island now.
WATTERS: Right. It's frigid.
O'REILLY: Right. They were right on the board.
WATTERS: That's right.
O'REILLY: Now, this is harmless in my opinion.
WATTERS: Mine, too.
O'REILLY: Nothing really wrong.
WATTERS: I have nothing against Nudity Week. In fact, I may have participated.
O'REILLY: No, let's not go there.
(LAUGHTER)
But the only thing is student activity fees. You know what I mean.
WATTERS: A miniscule amount of activity fee, --
O'REILLY: Miniscule.
WATTERS: -- they claim goes to Nudity Week.
O'REILLY: Just enough to buy the paint.
WATTERS: That's right. Well, you don't have any props or clothing, so it's pretty much straight.
O'REILLY: Right. And it's probably all for the paint.
WATTERS: That's right.
O'REILLY: And I've got to say, the kids, students, who talked to you, they were very respectful. They were very --
WATTERS: Very articulate and respectful. I have nothing against Brown University.
O'REILLY: No. We have nothing against Brown. We just have a few laughs at your expense.
(LAUGHTER)
And, you know, we wish you well. Watters, everybody.
WATTERS: Thank you.
O'REILLY: Going where very few men go.
