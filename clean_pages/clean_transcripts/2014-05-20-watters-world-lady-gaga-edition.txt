O'REILLY: Yes?
WATTERS: There's a lot of gender-bending and transsexuals.
O'REILLY: Because there performers like -- Cher is one --
WATTERS: Sure.
O'REILLY: -- that attract big gay audience.
WATTERS: Yes.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: But is this what this is evolving into --
WATTERS: I mean, I don't know if it's evolving. I think it's always been a big gay-themed crowd.
O'REILLY: Because -- but she was real mainstream with Bad Romance and all those songs.
WATTERS: She was. And, you know, I like Lady Gaga. I like that kind of music. I'm not embarrassed to talk about it.
O'REILLY: You should be.
(LAUGHTER)
No, some of her songs are catchy but --
WATTERS: Yes.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: -- but it looks to me like that's over, the mask adulation.
WATTERS: Right.
O'REILLY: As you said, her album sales and ticket sales are down.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: So, she's down.
WATTERS: -- last year. So, she's had some hip surgery. You know, the shock value is wearing off.

WATTERS: Miley Cyrus has kind of outpaced her in terms of that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
So, we'll see where she goes from here.
O'REILLY: You'll see.
WATTERS: I will -- I will --
O'REILLY: Yes, I'm not really going to follow her but you keep me posted.
WATTERS: That's my beat. I'm on a Lady Gaga beat.
O'REILLY: You know, you're getting real popular in certain areas there, Watters. You know you are.
WATTERS: Which areas are you talking about.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: I'm not even going to get into it. All right, there he is.
