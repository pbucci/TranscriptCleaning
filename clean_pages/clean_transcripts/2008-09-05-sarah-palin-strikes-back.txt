There's no doubt about it, the Republican crowd in St. Paul Wednesday night loved Governor Palin. She came across as normal, feisty and unafraid.
It was obvious the McCain campaign is positioning Sarah Palin as every woman, a person rather than a politician. And it worked Wednesday night.
The governor began by introducing herself in a very casual way.

GOV. SARAH PALIN: I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town. I was just your average hockey mom and signed up for the PTA. I love those hockey moms. You know, they say the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.
Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska, I was mayor of my hometown. I guess a small town mayor is sort of like a community organizer, except that you have actual responsibilities.

Well, "Talking Points" was surprised that Governor Palin went after Barack Obama. We told you that most Americans don't know Sarah Palin, and it might be wise for her to stay positive throughout the speech. Obviously, the governor ignored my advice, which might be a good thing, because it was obvious Wednesday night that Palin has no use for the media.

PALIN: I've learned quickly these last few days that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone. But here's a little news flash for those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion. I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this great country.

Now that was great theater. What a delivery. I mean, it was terrific. The Republican crowd doesn't like the media because the media's biased in favor of the Democrats. So if you're a Republican, you're annoyed. Governor Palin played right into that. That was smart.
But there's no question the governor has some work to do in building her resume so non-partisan voters will be more reassured. The governor went on to cite her expertise in energy, her reform record, which is impressive, and then she came back to Barack Obama.

PALIN: This is a man who has authored two memoirs, but not a single major law or even a reform, not even in the state Senate. When the stadium lights go out and those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot, when that happens, what exactly is our opponent's plan? What does he actually seek to accomplish after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet?

All right. Now that was obviously entertaining red meat for the GOP voters. What it means in the long run is debatable. What is not debatable is that Wednesday night, Sarah Palin became a big star.
And that's "The Memo."
Pinheads & Patriots
Country singer Carrie Underwood is recording a song called "Just Stand Up" and will donate all the proceeds to fight cancer. As you may know, Friday night there is a huge fund-raiser called Stand Up for Cancer. And Miss Underwood and everybody else helping out in this fund-raiser are patriots.
On the pinhead front, our pal Elton John had a little on-stage deal with singer Lily Allen.

LILY ALLEN, SINGER: We reached a very special point in the evening.
ELTON JOHN, SINGER: Are you going to have another drink?
ALLEN: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Elton. I'm 40 years younger than you. I've got my whole life ahead of me.
JOHN: I could still snort you under the table.

Lovely. Pinheads? No doubt.
