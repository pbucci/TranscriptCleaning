WATTERS: Do you support Obamacare?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I do.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I don't.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't even understand Obamacare. I don't think anyone understands it to be honest.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, we're Canadian.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't make me laugh.
WATTERS: Why do you like Obamacare?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's for the poor people.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's going to cost me more money in the long run.
WATTERS: What is Obamacare?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm -- I'm not sure.
WATTERS: Do you have healthcare?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know.
WATTERS: Don't get run over by a horse?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am --
WATTERS: Do you think the Obamacare rollout has been smooth?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know.
WATTERS: The Web site hasn't gone that well. What do you think happened?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The government is in charge of it.
WATTERS: Who do you think should be held responsible when the Web site crashes?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congress.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's got -- CIA written all over if it did crash. That's got the CIA written all over it if did crash.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I personally don't have health insurance.
WATTERS: How are you going to sign up?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Online.
WATTERS: What happened when you logged on?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It just -- it wouldn't let me go through the next page.
WATTERS: The President promised the American people.
OBAMA: If you like your healthcare plan, you will be able to keep your healthcare plan -- period.
WATTERS: Do you think the President lied to the American people?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would say it was a mildly intentional deception.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think he lied.
WATTERS: So if he didn't lie, why did he break his promise to the American people?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It looks like Fox is putting a question to me here.
WATTERS: Do you think the President is going to be able to win a third term?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. I just don't think Obama left a good taste in the mouth of the American public.
WATTERS: What does it taste like?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Great question, Jerry.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh Jesse seriously ok I suppose.
WATTERS: Are you an Obama supporter?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.
WATTERS: Did you vote for President Obama?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Isn't that supposed to be a secret who vote for, yes it's secret.
WATTERS: Why don't you want to tell me how voted for.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because we just met.
WATTERS: Do I have to buy you dinner first.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That would help for sure.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll have a Bloody Mary and steak sandwich and a steak sandwich please.
WATTERS: Do you ever watch the O'REILLY FACTOR on Fox News?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't watch it, man.
WATTERS: Why not?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's too infuriating how ignorant it is.
WATTERS: What do you know that he says has been ignorant?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Man, you know -- trying to think of -- he is entertaining. I love his book "Killing Kennedy."
WATTERS: A FACTOR fan?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: FACTOR fan.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes I like Bill O'Reilly. He's good.
WATTERS: Thank you very much.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lovely coat, too.
WATTERS: Thank you very much.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's really soft.
WATTERS: Yes don't tough the coat.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh I'm sorry.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look but don't touch.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The time is coming and you shall see. The Obamacare will rock indefinitely.
WATTERS: Oh.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes I think I want my money back.

O'REILLY: All right. You talked to how many people.
WATTERS: Twenty people, 10 people supported Obamacare. Five people did not support Obamacare and the other five were just confused or intoxicated.
O'REILLY: Confused. It's hard to believe and that was in the middle of the day right.
WATTERS: I know right in middle of the day on a Friday in Central Park.
O'REILLY: Did anybody object to you, you know, you had the Fox logo on the mike.
WATTERS: Yes.
O'REILLY: When they see that, does anybody like run the other way.
WATTERS: Well I was interviewing the black guy and a woman comes up to me and she goes don't listen to Fox News. They are not human.
O'REILLY: They're not human?
WATTERS: And the guy goes you must be a Republican. Get out of here. You don't know what you are talking about. And then he goes I'm on your side, man. And he goes get out of here, Fox is number one.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was the guy who did the rhyme?
WATTERS: Yes the guy with the poem at the end.
O'REILLY: The guy with the poem.
WATTERS: Yes.
O'REILLY: All right so we like him.
WATTERS: Right.
O'REILLY: The people who supported the 10 people, 50 percent support and this is New York City. You know, next to San Francisco, the liberal -- the most liberal city in the country.
WATTERS: Right.
O'REILLY: Did they know why they were supporting it? Did they have any idea?
WATTERS: Not a lot, I mean a lot of excuse making that's happening right now. You see the guy, the CIA crashed the Web site.
O'REILLY: Oh of course right.
WATTERS: It's getting very confusing right now. I don't think the White House talking points have seeped down to these people yet. They are a little overwhelmed.
O'REILLY: Right and I want to tell everybody, that you picked them at random, right?
WATTERS: Right.
O'REILLY: You are not looking for the dumbest kids on the block.
WATTERS: We just happen to run into some people who are a little disoriented.
O'REILLY: Yes no it's not unusual. Jesse Watters everybody.
