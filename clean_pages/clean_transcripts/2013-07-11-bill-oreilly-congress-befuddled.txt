In just a few moments we will have the inside story about immigration reform bill. Apparently some Republicans in the House want to kill it outright and they might succeed. That would mean the chaotic status quo would remain and the southern border would not be made more secure.
On the IRS front an investigation is supposed to be underway. But who knows? Certainly not Congress.
A new poll says NSA leaker Edward Snowden now considered a legitimate whistleblower by 55 percent of the American people. Some believe he's a hero for embarrassing the USA all over the world.
And what about the NSA snooping on phone calls and e-mails in the USA? Congress knows about as much as we do... nothing.
So you can see that the situation on Capitol Hill is dire. Congress doesn't know anything and it can't get anything done. The latest Gallup poll says just 15 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing and those 15 percent are brain dead. Congress isn't doing anything, problems are not getting solved. The president sits in the White House knowing that no matter what happens on his watch, Congress is not going to get to the bottom of it.
This is not the way the country is supposed to run. We elect these people to protect us, solve problems, and promote prosperity. Yet we have $17 trillion debt, a moribund economy. An immigration mess, scandal in the IRS and a foreign policy that looks like it was designed by Kim Kardashian.
Ideologues always blame the opposing president. Bush is an idiot. Obama is corrupt, whatever. But the bottom line is the U.S. Congress is inept. Nothing is getting done.
And that's "The Memo."
