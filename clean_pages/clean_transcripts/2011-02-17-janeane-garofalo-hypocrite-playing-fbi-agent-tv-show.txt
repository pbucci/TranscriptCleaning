BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "Culture Warriors" segment tonight: two hot topics, beginning with far-left actress Janeane Garofalo. As you may know, she is very anti-establishment.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JANEANE GAROFALO, ACTRESS: One person's terrorist organization is another person's national resistance movement. You know what I mean. There is plenty of people that refer to some of the military in this country and others and in Britain and in Israel and in other places as terrorist organizations. It just depends on how you phrase it.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: That's loopy. The definition of terrorism depends on provable activities, like targeting civilians. Ironically, the radical Ms. Garofalo played an FBI agent in "24" and is doing the same thing in a new CBS show called "Criminal Minds."
Here now, the "Warriors," Cathy Areu in for Gretchen Carlson and Fox News analyst Margaret Hoover. So is Janeane Garofalo being hypocritical?
MARGARET HOOVER, FOX NEWS ANALYST: No, she's not being hypocritical. She is -- ready for this, Bill?

O'REILLY: Yes.
HOOVER: Acting.
O'REILLY: Acting.
HOOVER: Acting. Acting isn't being who you are on screen. It's pretending that you're someone else.
O'REILLY: But isn't Janeane Garofalo's belief system being compromised by her role as an FBI agent?
HOOVER: Some people would say that it shows the extent of her professional abilities as an actor to credibly portray an FBI agent.

O'REILLY: Well, who's saying that she does that?
HOOVER: Well, I saw the trailer, and it looked pretty good.
O'REILLY: Saw the trailer? I mean...
HOOVER: She was pretty good in "24" season seven.
O'REILLY: Is it -- how do you feel about this, Cathy?

CATHY AREU, AUTHOR, "LATINO WISDOM": I feel she's a comedian first, then an actress, then an activist. So it's only normal for her to go back to her roots, and she's a great actor.
O'REILLY: You both have no problem with Ms. Garofalo.

HOOVER: No, wrong. I have a problem with her politics.
O'REILLY: No, no, no. Playing the FBI agents on television.
HOOVER: Of course not. Do I have a problem with Anthony Hopkins playing a cannibal on TV?
O'REILLY: No.
HOOVER: No. Of course not.
O'REILLY: Hoover, that's just loopy.
AREU: It's not Ann Coulter playing an abortion activist on, like, "Grey's Anatomy."

O'REILLY: Don't -- don't engage Hoover at that level.
AREU: Sorry, sorry.

O'REILLY: I, your humble correspondent, have a problem.

HOOVER: Why?

O'REILLY: Here is the problem for Janeane Garofalo, and I know you're watching, Janeane. You can't fool me. She's sending a bad message to the kids that the FBI are good. She's sending a terrible message to America's children. Janeane, you know that the FBI is a terrorist organization. You know that in your -- you are sending a bad message to the kids. You say, Hoover?
HOOVER: An actor has got to eat. She's got to...
O'REILLY: Now it's about eating?

HOOVER: I've just got -- you've got to put food on the table. She says she cannot play…
O'REILLY: Can't she play -- can't she play Noam Chomsky's daughter?
HOOVER: Don't always get to pick your roles. That was funny.
O'REILLY: Thank you. I'm trying. Bad message to the kids, Cathy. You know it.
AREU: She said if she plays an assassin, it doesn't mean she's going to kill someone.
O'REILLY: The kids. You're dodging the kids question.
AREU: She's not anti-FBI.
O'REILLY: No. But she's showing the kids the FBI are good. That's - - come on.
AREU: She's never been anti-FBI.

O'REILLY: Oh, she hasn't?

AREU: No.

O'REILLY: No?
HOOVER: She's just anti-establishment.
O'REILLY: I see. So the FBI...

AREU: Anti-FBI.
HOOVER: Or pro-FBI for all I know.
O'REILLY: Are you sure, Cathy, that she thinks the FBI are good? You sure in the wiretaps? You sure? I got you guys. I got you both. All right.
Go to Minnesota while I'm ahead.
HOOVER: Pretty big leap.
O'REILLY: Minnetonka High School in Minnesota, "dance like your grandma's watching." They are telling these kids -- that's not the kids; I don't know who these people are -- not to do grinding dances, which high school kids are now doing. And you say, Hoover?
HOOVER: I say that there is almost the same amount of outrage at this as there was over Elvis' gyrating.

O'REILLY: OK. So you think Elvis on stage in his blue suede shoes gyrating...
HOOVER: Grinding equivalent.

O'REILLY: ...is the moral equivalent...

HOOVER: Absolutely.
O'REILLY: ...to 15-year-olds mashed together. You see it as just the same thing?
HOOVER: I will tell you that as a 15-year-old, no, as a 12-year- old...

O'REILLY: Yes.
HOOVER: …I may or may not have participated in this sort of technical term "grinding." And I will tell you that I was perfectly G-rated in every other area of my life. Just because they're doing the grinding, just because they're grinding doesn't mean they're having sex.

O'REILLY: But when you got onto the high school dance floor, you became a wild child. Now, do you see that Hoover's Elvis comparison may be a little off?
AREU: So far off. It's up to the schools to keep things reasonable and appropriate. It's completely inappropriate for them to endorse that kind of behavior. And if it's happening on school property on school grounds during school times during a school activity, it's completely inappropriate.

O'REILLY: All right, so you disagree and you say that "dance like grandma is watching" is a good program?
AREU: I love the program.

O'REILLY: You love it?
AREU: I think it's great.
O'REILLY: But it has to be carried a step further. Grandma should be chaperoning the dances. Get the grandmas in. Give them pans or whatever is -- and then have them do it. I'll tell you what. That would work. You know, it would work to have the grandmas go up and go, "Hey, what are you doing?"

AREU: Maybe. That's inappropriate.

HOOVER: I think it's much ado about nothing. I really do.
O'REILLY: So if you were a mom and your 15-year-old were out there...
HOOVER: I think you pick your battles, and I think kids are doing bad stuff. This is not bad stuff.

AREU: This is a battle to pick.
O'REILLY: I don't think I want that for my kid. All right. "Culture Warriors," everybody. Looking out for the kids.
