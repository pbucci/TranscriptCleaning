BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "Back of the Book" segment tonight, "Reality Check," where the truth is sometimes very disturbing.
"Check" one: As you may know, the General Electric corporation owns NBC News, and there is compelling evidence that NBC is giving President Obama favorable treatment so that GE will be awarded billions — billions — in government contracts.
Two weeks ago, a fawning special anchored by Brian Williams brought criticism from many quarters, some charging the softball is part of GE's plan to put the president in a positive light in return for federal dollars — big federal dollars. And now there are charges that GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt and NBC boss Jeff Zucker have expanded the strategy to include sliming Republicans. That is using NBC News not only to promote Obama but demean the opposing party. Recently, an NBC anchor, not a commentator, an anchor, Contessa Brewer, demonstrated this in a discussion about Sarah Palin.

CONTESSA BREWER, NBC ANCHOR: Why does she take such offense? She called him pathetic, so she obviously took offense. Why was she so offended by David Letterman?
JOHN ZIEGLER, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Well, Contessa, since you're a female, you might be a better expert on whether or not it's appropriate to call a public figure slutty with — for no apparent reason and to joke about her daughter being knocked up in the middle of Yankee Stadium while she's at the game.
BREWER: You know, actually...
ZIEGLER: How would you — how would you feel about it?
BREWER: John, that's actually happened to me. And I'm fine, I'm still here. I'm...
ZIEGLER: Really? David Letterman joked about you being slutty...
BREWER: No, not David Letterman.
ZIEGLER: And about your daughter being knocked up.
BREWER: It happened to me publicly.

O'REILLY: Obviously, Ms. Brewer has little sympathy for Governor Palin.
"Check" two: "Factor" producer Griff Jenkins was assigned to cover an ACORN event in Washington, but the group would not allow him inside. But they did let in some left-wing media.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS PRODUCER: Is he inside? Because he's — he's with the press, and we were told it was closed press.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're actually friends.
JENKINS: But if he's inside, he's a member of the press, and I was told it was closed press. So that would be inconsistent. It was closed to the press, but you're inside. Who are you again?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm opinion media. Are you opinion media?
JENKINS: Who are you?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you opinion media?
JENKINS: Again, who are you? I'm working, I'm sorry. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I didn't push. Do you want to get this guy out of here? I just want to know.
JENKINS: He's pushing my cameraman.

O'REILLY: Now, after our polite and interesting discussion with the ACORN CEO recently, I'm surprised that they acted that way with Griff.
"Check" three: Earlier this week, Senator Barbara Boxer was questioning General Michael Walsh, who's with the Army Corps of Engineers.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BARBARA BOXER, D-CALIF.: Why has it been delayed?
MICHAEL WALSH, ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS: Ma'am, the LACPR is...
BOXER: Do me a favor. Could you say "senator" instead of "ma'am"?
WALSH: Yes.
BOXER: It's just a thing. I worked so hard to get that title, so I would appreciate it. Yes, thank you.
WALSH: Yes, Senator.

O'REILLY: Now, the general is just following military protocol when he called Senator Boxer "ma'am."
"Check" four: At the Country Music TV Awards on Tuesday, this happened:

T-PAIN: We are here to present the Bucko (ph) for Wide Open Country Video of the Year. And the winner is — shout out to Bill O'Reilly. Holler at me on Twitter — "All Summer Long," Kid Rock.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: I think that's the guy named T-Pain. I'm not sure. Holler at him on Twitter. Is that legal? Can you do that? Probably not going to happen.
