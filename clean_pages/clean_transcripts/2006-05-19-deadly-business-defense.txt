The deadly business of defending America. Did you know that more than 100,000 illegal aliens are currently in U.S. prisons after being convicted of felonies? Did you know that Iraqi civilian militias are murdering thousands of people — murdering them — every month in that country? Did you know that American Marines are being investigated for killing unarmed Iraqi women and children? And the charges may have validity.
All of that winds up on desk of Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary of Defense. Every day it's a new threat against this country or a new attack or something even worse. Who would want that job? Well, tonight and tomorrow I will try to get some answers about very complicated and vital questions.
As you know we're living in dangerous times and Secretary Rumsfeld is one of those charged with keeping us safe. Some say he's the right man for the job, and others say no, but after hearing the upcoming conversation, there's little doubt about where he stands.
And that's "The Memo."
