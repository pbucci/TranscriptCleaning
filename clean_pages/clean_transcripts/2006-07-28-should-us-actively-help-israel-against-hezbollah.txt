A new CBS News/New York Times poll asks should the USA take the lead in solving international crises? Fifty-nine percent said no. The U.N. and other countries should do it. Thirty-one percent believe the USA should be the primary player.
But there's one big problem: The U.N. is not capable of controlling Hezbollah or any other terror group. As for other countries helping out? Good luck.
The latest dispatch from the Al Qaeda killers urges all Islamic fascists to travel to the Middle East and kill Jews. Bin Laden's second in command, Zawahiri, issued that order on videotape yesterday.
"Talking Points" has been telling you all along that these jihadists are joined together by hatred of Jews and Americans. The World War III concept is that Islamic fascism has to be confronted in all its forms.
But many Americans do not yet get that, as the CBS poll demonstrated. If anybody thinks we can sit out the jihad, they're wrong. Right now, Israel is doing us a favor by attacking Hezbollah. We Americans are fortunate we have an ocean between us and the Islamic killers. If we didn't, we'd be facing this in the good old USA.
So bottom line, whoever is fighting the terrorists is our friend. Whoever is helping them is our enemy.
And that's "The Memo."
The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day
As we told you in the "Talking Points Memo" the New York Times, along with CBS News, put out a new poll about how Americans think President Bush is handling the terror war.
But those two news agencies headlined the poll findings in very different ways on their Internet sites. The Times says: "Americans Showing Isolationist Streak." But CBS News headlines: "World Doesn't Respect Bush."
Ridiculous? You make the call. Keeping in mind they could have come up with 100 different headlines based on the polling data.
