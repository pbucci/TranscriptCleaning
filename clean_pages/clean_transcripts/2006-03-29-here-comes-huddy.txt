BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "Back of the Book" segment tonight, we continue our look at some women who have helped make FOX News be the enormous success it is. And just who are these ladies? We thought you might want to know. With us now, the co-host of "Dayside," Juliet Huddy.
Juliet.
JULIET HUDDY, CO-HOST, "DAYSIDE": Yes.
O'REILLY: That's unusual. How did that come about?
HUDDY: My dad was into all those literature type names.
O'REILLY: Shakespeare.
HUDDY: Shakespeare, yes.
O'REILLY: Into that?
HUDDY: Yes. And "Mephistopheles." It was either Juliet or Scarlett. And they put the names in a hat, and thank God it was Juliet.
O'REILLY: Your father was a writer for the Miami Herald when I was teaching school down there in the '70s.
HUDDY: That's what he said, yes. I didn't know you were that old.
O'REILLY: Yes, I am. I'm ancient. Heavily made up every night. So he was in the media.
HUDDY: Yes.
O'REILLY: Did you always want to be a TV person?
HUDDY: I did. I just never thought that there was anything else. And he's a pretty tough guy. And he always...
O'REILLY: Your father is?
HUDDY: Oh, yes. And he just kind of drilled it into my head. I was the girl that did really good book reports but I couldn't add. So it was just kind of — you know, it was a natural progression.
O'REILLY: But he wanted you to be a media person?
HUDDY: He just — I don't — I think he just expected that I would be because I had so many characteristics that he had. Just in school, my personality. I take after him.
O'REILLY: All right. So you followed in your father's footsteps?
HUDDY: Yes. He didn't force me. I followed willingly.
O'REILLY: Juliet Huddy is interesting. She went to the University of Missouri J-school. OK?
HUDDY: These notes here.
O'REILLY: After you get out of J-school, you get your first job. I had to go to Scranton, Pennsylvania, and you know, work my way up.
HUDDY: Yes.
O'REILLY: Juliet had an interesting first job. She worked at a station in California, which her parents bought.
HUDDY: It wasn't my first job, O'Reilly.
O'REILLY: Which her parents bought.
HUDDY: Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on a second, Bud. You're OK with nepotism. It's not a bad thing.
O'REILLY: Your parents buy the station.
HUDDY: First of all, I went to the University of Missouri. Didn't get into the journalism school, because I discovered boys and partying, unfortunately.
O'REILLY: So you went to sociology.
HUDDY: Political science and sociology.
O'REILLY: OK, great.
HUDDY: Oh, man, I knew this was going to be trouble. But I ended up getting a job at a local radio station, O'Reilly.
O'REILLY: And then you go work as a TV reporter and your parents bought the station, correct? Why didn't I get that deal? All right.
HUDDY: I worked very hard, though. I have to say...
O'REILLY: I understand.
HUDDY: Wait, wait, wait. We're not moving on to another subject now. I had to work very hard. It was hard working for my parents.
O'REILLY: But you would concede you had a little bit of an advantage?
HUDDY: A lot of a bit of an advantage.
O'REILLY: OK.
HUDDY: Why did I come on this show?
O'REILLY: I'm in Scranton. My parents don't even know what state I'm living in. She's in the station that her parents buy.
HUDDY: But can you imagine working, though — you don't know my dad, so you don't know how difficult it was.
O'REILLY: I'm sure he was brutal. OK, so how do you go from local news to FOX News?
HUDDY: I was working for the local affiliate in Jacksonville, Florida. And I was...
O'REILLY: Your parents didn't own that station?
HUDDY: They didn't own that station.
O'REILLY: OK.
HUDDY: No, it was my uncle. No, I'm just kidding.
O'REILLY: You're working in Jacksonville.
HUDDY: I worked at the local Jacksonville station. And FOX had just started up. Big daddy FOX had just started up.
O'REILLY: Right.
HUDDY: And there was a big story breaking down there. Billy Graham was hospitalized. So the big FOX called little FOX up and said can we get one of your reporters, have them do the live shots? And I did it, and it worked out.
O'REILLY: And they saw you, and then they hired you.
HUDDY: And Roger Ailes is my guru.
O'REILLY: That happens a lot. We use local reporters. We see they're good, and we bring them up to New York.
HUDDY: I was qualified to be...
O'REILLY: Now you're a host, a daytime host. Is that more fun than being in the field?
HUDDY: I wouldn't say it's more fun. It's just it's completely different. I like it a lot more, because it allows me — the format of our show allows me to show personality, and we can kind of marry the craziness with the serious news.
O'REILLY: Serious stuff, because you do both. And you get free clothes, too.
HUDDY: Yes. That's not a bad deal.
O'REILLY: You get free clothes, and...
HUDDY: When I'm not stealing them, I get them free.
O'REILLY: Do your parents still own the station? Because I may want a job.
HUDDY: No, they don't.
O'REILLY: They don't? OK.
All right. Juliet, good sport for coming on. We appreciate it, Juliet.
HUDDY: Thank you, Bill.
O'REILLY: Check her out on "Dayside" everyone.
