It has been a bizarre few days for the President. Yesterday, he was in Colorado raising money and socializing, drinking beer, playing pool. In a calm time there would be nothing wrong with that but this is far from a calm time. War could break out in the Middle East at any moment and we now have about 60,000 foreign children under U.S. care because the southern border is so chaotic. Many are calling that a humanitarian disaster and it is.
So let's see: possible war in the Middle East, a humanitarian disaster on the border and Barack Obama is socializing? Not good.
Today, the President arrived in Texas for more fundraising and socializing. He is refusing to go to the border which has even some of his own supporters mystified.

REP. HENRY CUELLAR (D), TEXAS: He is so close to the border. And let me say this when I saw and I hate to use the word "bizarre", but under the circumstances, when he is shown playing pool in Colorado, drinking a beer and he can't even go 242 miles to the Texas border and plus if he doesn't want to go down to the border there is the Lachlan Air Force Base that is where HHS is holding some of the young kids from the border. He can at least make that that trip to San Antonio.

O'REILLY: And that's a Democrat. So instead of visiting the border the President met with Governor Perry later this afternoon in Dallas. After that the President assessed the border situation basically blaming the House of Representatives for failing to deal with the issue and not passing a comprehensive immigration law.

OBAMA: Congress has the capacity to work with us, work with state officials and local officials and faith based groups and not for profits who are helping to care for these kids. Congress has the capacity to work with all parties concerned to directly address this situation.

O'REILLY: So he punted to Congress. In the Q&A that followed his remarks, the President addressed the National Guard being sent to the border that we here, have endorsed.

OBAMA: The Governor's one concern that he mentioned to me was that setting aside the supplemental, I should go ahead and authorize having National Guard troops surge at the border right away. And what I told him is we are happy to consider how we could deploy National Guard down there but that's a temporary solution. That's not a permanent solution.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: So what? So what? Stop the bleeding, Mr. President. Protect the poor kids who are being exploited. Come on, take some action.
It is indeed strange that President Obama does not see the damage being done to his own legacy. I mean when the mainstream media, which generally adores the man, starts to hammer him, you would think he would wake up and smell the chaos. But no, the President does not seem to feel any sense of urgency to confront growing problems all over the world. Even his most dedicated supporters sound confused.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D), TEXAS: It's almost like the crisis in Syria generated this enormous crisis on the border of Jordan. Certainly doesn't equal what we are doing. But that's what happens and that's what happened. I don't think in any way you can fault the administration for this.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: What? Ms. Lee is babbling. She makes absolutely no sense. Anyone who doesn't fault the administration for the border mess and the rise of terrorism in the Middle East is a moron, m-o-r-o-n, moron.
Finally, let's deal with the compassion issue. Today the U.N. is lobbying to designate many of the children and their guardians who illegally enter the USA as refugees; the United Nations, believing that Central American countries are somehow oppressing their populations.
Let me tell you something, Central America has been out of control for decades, I covered the El Salvador war. And the U.N. knows it is out of control. But that body would love, would love to dump the entire problem of incompetent and corrupt governments and Central Americans right into the lap of the American taxpayer.
If you watch THE FACTOR, you know we've had some intense debates with those who believe that we should accept every child who lives in dire circumstance around the world. And if you disagree with that opinion, you are a mean person, un-Christian. But the harsh truth is that America simply cannot assimilate the oppressed populations of the world including the poor children.
Our own poor children are getting short changed because of the billions of dollars the government is spending trying to provide social justice for the rest of the world. America is nearly bankrupt, and believe me that is not compassionate towards we the people.
I myself give hundreds of thousands of dollars to poor kids in Mexico and Haiti and other troubled places around the globe. All Americans should do what we can do to help the poor. But creating huge social and economic problems inside our own country is irresponsible and un-American -- period.
And that's "The Memo."
