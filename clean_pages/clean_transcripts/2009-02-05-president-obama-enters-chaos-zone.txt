Mr. Obama has only been in office for two weeks, but it feels like two months, doesn't it?
Tuesday, he gave a round of interviews, and the president was on the defensive. So far, three of his personnel picks have had tax problems, including Tom Daschle, who had to quit Tuesday.

BARACK OBAMA: I think Tom's an outstanding person. I think this was an unintentional mistake on his part, but a substantial one. And there's no excuse for the mistake. He took responsibility for it. Ultimately, I have to take responsibility for a process that resulted in us not having a HHS secretary at a time when people need relief on their health care costs.

Now, President Obama is smart for taking responsibility. Everybody in Washington knows Tom Daschle and his wife Linda have made millions cavorting with fat cats. If Obama did not know that, he should have. I mean, come on. You get a car and a driver from some guy, and you don't pay taxes on it? Please.
And then there is the economic stimulus plan. Here I have some sympathy for President Obama. He has one chance, and one chance only. When Congress passes this trillion-dollar gamble, it had better work.
Therefore, President Obama was smart to get on the side of the folks and demand that any company getting taxpayer dollars cap executive salaries at a half-million bucks:

OBAMA: This is America. We don't disparage wealth. We don't begrudge anybody for achieving success. We certainly believe that success should be rewarded. But what gets people upset, and rightfully so, are executives being rewarded for failure, especially when those rewards are subsidized by U.S. taxpayers, many of whom are having a tough time themselves.

What I can't tell you is whether the chaos Barack Obama is now experiencing is normal. We are obviously living in turbulent, dangerous times, and for President Obama to succeed he has to be a very strong leader, someone who can not only take the blame for stuff that goes wrong, but who can actually prevent bad things from happening.
Again, the president should have known Tom Daschle was a risky choice.
Finally, "Talking Points" got a kick out of this exchange between the president and Chris Wallace:

CHRIS WALLACE, HOST, "FOX NEWS SUNDAY": You were widely quoted…
OBAMA: Yes.
WALLACE: ...when you met with the House GOP Caucus saying, go ahead, feel free to whack me. I'll watch FOX News and feel bad about myself. Did you say that?
OBAMA: That one I did say.
WALLACE: Is — perhaps — let me just raise the possibility.
OBAMA: Yeah.
WALLACE: Are you a trifle thin-skinned?
OBAMA: No, no, no. I said it in good humor. I think everybody understood that was a joke.

And of course, we need all the levity we can get.
And that's "The Memo."
Pinheads & Patriots
The founder of Habitat for Humanity, Millard Fuller, has died in Georgia. The 74-year-old walked away from a lucrative business career and devoted his entire life to building houses for the poor. Habitat is now known all over the world. To get a house, you have to build houses for other people. That's the interesting twist the organization provides. Millard Fuller was a patriot and a humanitarian.
On the pinhead front, remember the movie "Bonnie and Clyde"?

FAYE DUNAWAY, ACTRESS: You know, we are just about the friendliest folks you would ever want to meet. Big old Texas Ranger waves his gun at us, and we just welcome him like he was one of our own.
WARREN BEATTY, ACTOR: Get the Kodak.

Well, now there's going to be a remake, and — wait for it — Hilary Duff is playing Bonnie. Whoa! The original Bonnie, Faye Dunaway, doesn't like that, asked why they couldn't cast a real actress, whereupon Miss Duff replied.

HILARY DUFF, ACTRESS: I think that my fans that are going to see the movie don't even know who she is. So you know, I think it was a little unnecessary. But I might be mad if I looked like that now, too.

Well, just for the information, here's what Ms. Dunaway looks like now. Who's the pinhead? You make the call. I'm not getting in the middle of that.
