BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "Personal Story" segment tonight: As you may know, Sarah Palin is backing the Tea Party guy Joe Miller, who's running for the Senate in Alaska. The race is tight between him and write-in candidate Lisa Murkowski, also a Republican.
Last Thursday, members of a local CBS affiliate news team made a mistake with a cell phone and were heard disparaging Mr. Miller, and that does not sit well with Ms. Palin.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 1: We know that out of all the people that will show up tonight, at least one of them will be a registered sex offender.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have to find that one person (INAUDIBLE).
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 1: And the one thing we can do is -- we won't know, we won't know but if there is any sort of chaos whatsoever, we can put out a Twitter and Facebook alert saying what the -- "Hey, Joe Miller punched at rally."
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 2: Kinda like Rand Paul. I like that. That's a good one.

SARAH PALIN, FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR: Those are corrupts bastards, Chris. That's what is wrong with the media today. When they have their chosen one and nine times out of ten, heck ten times out of ten in the liberal media, it's going to be the liberal is the chosen one. So we have a problem there with what Joe Miller has had to face.
(END VIDEO CLIP, "FOX NEWS SUNDAY")
O'REILLY: All right. With us now, former governor of Alaska, current Fox News analyst, Sarah Palin. Did you really call them bastards?
SARAH PALIN, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Well, up there -- and it's not a term of endearment.
O'REILLY: No, I know that.
PALIN: There is a group of what had been perceived as corrupt politicians that went by the CBC moniker, the corrupt "bleep" club.
O'REILLY: Yes.
PALIN: So Alaskans understood exactly what I was talking about.
O'REILLY: So, you had -- you had -- that was in context -- that reference was in context to Alaska politics.
PALIN: To the CBC group up in Alaska.
O'REILLY: Well, I don't mind you calling…
PALIN: Some of them are thrown now in prison for corruption.
O'REILLY: I don't mind you just doing an ad hominem attack. Those people should all be fired immediately.
PALIN: It was a little bit of that, too. Yes.
O'REILLY: Yes. They should all be fired immediately. That is not a CBS-owned station. It's an affiliated station that carries CBS programming. Those people should be fired.
PALIN: Yes.
O'REILLY: I mean, that's ridiculous.
PALIN: Absolutely. There's no accountability, and this bogus explanation of this "Leave It to Beaver" guy, who tried to explain it.

O'REILLY: You wouldn't think that would happen in a place like Alaska, when the population reflects pretty much what your belief system is. It's a very red state. It is very conservative, but the media is liberal in Alaska.
PALIN: Absolutely. Very, very liberal, very biased. And, you know, I hate to see somebody else go through what Todd and I and my administration, what we had gone through and what we continue to go through in Alaska with the local media. But, there is light shed now via this tape that…
O'REILLY: Absolutely.
PALIN: Joe Miller was suffering…
O'REILLY: There is no doubt with it.
PALIN: There is light shed on what other people go through up there.
O'REILLY: Trying to trump up something against Miller.
PALIN: Yes.
O'REILLY: OK. Do you believe that this vote tomorrow is a referendum against liberalism? Do you think that Americans are rebelling against liberalism?
PALIN: Absolutely. Americans are going to say tomorrow enough is enough and let's get some common sense solutions in there and they turn things around.

O'REILLY: So, it's an anti-liberal vote rather than a pro anything else vote.
PALIN: It is an anti-big government overreach vote and it is a "Let's get back to common sense vote," so yes.
O'REILLY: OK because that's what liberalism is, big government and let the government control.
PALIN: Yes.
O'REILLY: Now, can you be too far right as a candidate? Some of the candidates that you backed aren't going to win because they are perceived as being too far out there.
PALIN: Like who?
O'REILLY: Christine O'Donnell.
PALIN: If she doesn't win, I'm still very happy to have thrown at least my name in an endorsement towards Christine as opposed to her opponent in the primary and then, of course, in the…
O'REILLY: But he would have won.
PALIN: Not necessarily. Nobody guarantees that. So, you know, I don't believe that…
O'REILLY: No. He was way ahead in the poll…
PALIN: Well, I don't believe. But, here's the deal.
O'REILLY: OK. Go ahead.
PALIN: He's for cap and tax, wishy-washy on Obamacare.
O'REILLY: Certainly, he's not a conservative guy.
PALIN: So why in the world would I go along to get along like a lot of the RINOs do and just say yes to somebody who would cast liberal votes anyway once they got there and…
O'REILLY: RINOs are Republicans in Name Only. OK, but Rove would say and has said publicly, look, he may not be your favorite guy, but this guy probably could have beaten Coons and that would have thrown the Senate into Republican hands, which would further diminish President Obama's power.
PALIN: Yes, and that kind of thinking of just embracing the status quo, oh guys that maybe could have been a safe bet and could have won anyway. That status quo, that is the mess that we are in.

O'REILLY: So you would rather not have control of the Senate and have ideological purity than at least give a couple of guys who you are not too crazy about…
PALIN: Show me the polls or show me any numbers that guarantee that the Republican…
O'REILLY: There's no guarantee…
PALIN: …would have won anyway.
O'REILLY: No, but he was way ahead. What's his name, the skinny guy, the old guy?
PALIN: Castle is who she defeated.
O'REILLY: Castle -- Castle. Thank you.

PALIN: Right. She defeated Castle.
O'REILLY: You're smarter than everybody upstairs.
PALIN: You're darn right I am.
O'REILLY: They are all going like this, "What is he talking about?" Castle. OK. Can you be too far right in this country?
PALIN: At this point in time…
O'REILLY: Yes.
PALIN: …with the state of the union, no.
O'REILLY: Yes. You can't be too far right.

PALIN: Any of that far-right ideological bent that somebody would have is going to balance out the extreme far-left liberal policies that are being adopted, this government takeover of our private sector.
O'REILLY: So you can't -- do you know Paladino who's running for governor here? You know him?

PALIN: I never met him, but I know about him.
O'REILLY: OK. But he's pretty far right out there.
PALIN: Well, he is running for governor, so that's up to the New Yorkers to decide.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: All right, I know that.
PALIN: But, no. A far right bent would be a healthy -- we need a balance of power here, Bill. Look at this extreme liberalism that has control of the House and the Senate and the White House right now. We have got to balance that out. That's another message that will be sent on Tuesday against failed policy, against the monopoly of power in Congress and in the White House.
O'REILLY: Yes, I'm just wondering if you get candidates though who do say crazy things on the right or the left, I think most Americans aren't going to vote for them.
PALIN: Yes and look at those crazy things like those on the left have said like Grayson and Barney Frank. I mean, we can go…
O'REILLY: They are both in trouble, Grayson and Barney. You just heard Barney's lending his own money. Do you know Barney?
PALIN: Yes. I spoke with him, yes.
O'REILLY: You try to get a loan from Barney. Go ahead, try.
PALIN: We had an event where Barney Frank was the Democrat or the liberal speaker and as opposed to me on the right as the speaker. I got up there at the podium and I said, "You know what's odd about this is, I'm perceived as the controversial one, and he is the, you know, he's the mainstream one." Only in...
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: Yes. Well, they are both in trouble. Now, out in the most intriguing race to me of all of them is Sharron Angle vs. Harry Reid.
PALIN: Absolutely. Absolutely.
O'REILLY: OK. Now, you threw in with Angle fairly early, right?
PALIN: Sure. Yes.

O'REILLY: What is it about her that you like, other than the ideological purity? Is there anything else?
PALIN: She not only has a good resume where she served honorably in her own legislature there. So she has a good political record and that is a point right there: She has a record. We know where she's going to be on positions, on policies, on issues, because she has voted on those in the past. But she also has a vision for America that is what we need right now.
O'REILLY: Yes, coincides with your vision.
PALIN: It is.

O'REILLY: How bad is Reid?
PALIN: Reid is -- he is part of the problem, and he would just perpetuate more of the problem. He believes that government is the answer.

O'REILLY: OK, so it's as the as simple as that. It is just basically that.
PALIN: It's as simple as that, and he has the record to prove it. We learned because of Obama now, don't vote for anybody when you don't know their record, when they don't have a record. You have to know what it is that they would stand for.
O'REILLY: OK. Now, you've been teasing people with the presidential thing, You know you're doing that. You know, "if nobody else wants to run, I will run," that kind of thing.
PALIN: Yes, as long as it would perceive as tease, well that would be an honest answer, I don't know if I'm going to run or not.
O'REILLY: OK, but it's possible.
PALIN: It's possible.
O'REILLY: It's possible. So, if you will run, will you give me an interview? Can I continue to interview you if you run?
PALIN: Well, of course.
O'REILLY: OK. Now, I have it. Now, I have it on videotape. Well, that would be very interesting if you run. That would be really interesting.
PALIN: It would be very interesting, I'm sure.
O'REILLY: Right.
PALIN: Because there is like curiosity factor that never seems to diminish.

O'REILLY: And they can't say anything worse about you, right?
PALIN: That's the thing. It would be a freeing, unconventional…
O'REILLY: Right.
PALIN: Very intimate run.
O'REILLY: Right, they have already taken every shot they can take.
PALIN: You would think so. I mean, they still question whose kid is that kid, is it really my kid and, you know, so, it's never ending, But it would be…
O'REILLY: Well, governor, you know, we're going to keep a close eye on it. We really appreciate you coming in tonight.
PALIN: Of course, thank you.

O'REILLY: Thank you very much.
PALIN: Thank you.
