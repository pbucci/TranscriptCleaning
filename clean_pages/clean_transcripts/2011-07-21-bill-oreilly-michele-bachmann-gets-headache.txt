Campaigning for the presidency is fraught with danger. You have to have security wherever you go because violent people are everywhere. And then there is the press, which may not be violent, but certainly there are many nuts in the media especially with all these handheld cameras.
Enter Michele Bachmann. A website reporting she is taking medication for migraine headaches. Predictably, that set off a frenzy of media activity. I'm not exactly sure why; headaches are very common things.
Anyway ABC News correspondent Brian Ross tried to ask the Congresswoman about the headache deal and if it affected her work on the Hill.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRIAN ROSS, ABC NEWS CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: I asked her about the votes and she wouldn't answer the question. She read a statement and then walked away and I attempted to ask her that question "Have you missed any congressional votes because of these migraines?"
(CROSSTALK)
ROSS: And the staff came up and pushed me away.

Not good. You may remember back in 2008 I, your humble correspondent, had a similar situation when a guy working for then-Senator Obama tried to stop me from asking him a question.

O'REILLY: Don't block the shot, got it. Don't block the shot.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm working sir.
O'REILLY: No you're not, you're blocking the shot, get over there.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sir.
O'REILLY: Get him out of there.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No I don't want to do that.
O'REILLY: We have a right to be here to shoot the shot.
Hey, senator!
Yes, that's really low class, pal. Really low class and everybody in the world will see it.
Hey Senator, a word, please? Senator, a word, please? Senator, we came all the way up to see you. Senator, a word.
BARACK OBAMA, THEN-SENATOR/CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let me shake your hand.
O'REILLY: Thank you.
OBAMA: It's good to see you.

Subsequently, that guy, Marvin Nicholson and, I had a conversation and there are no hard feelings, but that illustrates the problem with security going overboard. Of course, if you like the candidate, then you want security to push the media around, but it's wrong to do that.
Michele Bachmann is new to national politics and she'll have to figure it out just as Barack Obama did. All the candidates have to be very, very careful, but their security must be mature enough to know who is the enemy and who is just trying to do his job.
And that's "The Memo."
Pinheads & Patriots
In Lexington, Kentucky, at the Bluegrass Fair. they set up a booth mocking Casey Anthony.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Somebody is getting serious about this, aren't you?
Why are you throwing at the guilty sign? I'm innocent. Remember?
Look at that pretty little girl. You guys need a babysitter for the night?
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) real bad. I've been in prison too long.
Hey, you must think I'm guilty, too. Why can't you hit it, then?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are hoping that it's taken in a fun way so that people coming out can release some of their frustrations about what has happened in the last few months.

Well, that display engendered a lot of controversy, so the organizers took it down. I'm not so sure about that. Certainly, Ms. Anthony should be held accountable in the public arena. That seems to be a rather harmless way to do it. So I believe it was a pinheaded move to close the dunk tank.
