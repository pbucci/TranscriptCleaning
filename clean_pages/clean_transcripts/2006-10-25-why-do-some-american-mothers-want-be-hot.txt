BILL O'REILLY, HOST: "Back of the Book" segment tonight, a pharmaceutical company that sells anti-wrinkle cream is looking for a spokesperson to do media. So they are sponsoring a Hottest Mom in America contest, where mothers strut their stuff in various ways. The ultimate hot mom will get about $50,000 and all the anti-wrinkle cream they can use.
Joining us now from Jacksonville, Florida, hot mom contestant Traci Pangonas and from West Palm Beach, Kelly Heyniger.
Kelly, we'll begin with you. You have two young children. You're 36 years old. Why do you want to be a hot mom?
KELLY HEYNIGER, HOT MOM CONTESTANT: Well, I auditioned for this contest because of the $25,000 scholarship that they were offering and the $25,000, in cash. So that's why I did it.
O'REILLY: All right. So it's a pure money play for you. You're a single mother, and you know, people understand that. But there could be a downside for your son, eight years old, because kids might say stuff and tease them about it, could they not?
HEYNIGER: Very possibly, but he's only eight years old, and we haven't really had to deal with anything like that right now. He really doesn't understand what hot means or that his mom's a hot mom. He just thinks I'm the best mom.
O'REILLY: So far he's been protected from any downside. Do you see, Kelly, any downside to what you're doing?
HEYNIGER: Yes, because I'm putting myself out for criticism. And I think any time you put yourself in front of the world, somebody's going to criticize you. But that's just something that I'll have to deal with.
O'REILLY: OK, now Traci, I have to ask you this question. You are Mrs. Rhode Island, currently. Is that correct?
TRACI PANGONAS, HOT MOM CONTESTANT: I am. I'm Mrs. Rhode Island, United States.
O'REILLY: All right, but you live in Florida. How does that work?
PANGONAS: I do. As long as you have been a resident of a state you may represent it, and I was in the top 10 for Mrs. Florida, United States.
O'REILLY: OK. All right, so you're Mrs. Rhode Island, but you're living in Florida. I don't know, if I were in Rhode Island, I think I might want Mrs. Rhode Island to be in Rhode Island, but what do I know?
PANGONAS: Well, when you compete at the national level.
O'REILLY: Yes, I understand. Why did you put yourself into this hot mom deal?
PANGONAS: Because I am hot.
O'REILLY: We can hose you down.
PANGONAS: OK, I might let you. No, the main thing is I think it's about empowering other women. And you know, I think I'm a good role model and a good spokesperson for the average mother.
I am a mother of four. And I do carpooling. I'm the home mom, and I do own my own business. And I'm not trying to be super mom, but along the way, I am a personal trainer and aerobics instructor. So I like to stay fit.
O'REILLY: OK, so a hot mom is what? Define it for me?
PANGONAS: A hot mom is well-rounded, encompasses the morals and values that we hope that — like the 50's would encompass. Trying not to be the super mom...
O'REILLY: Ozzie — Harriet Nelson was a hot mom?
PANGONAS: Hey, she cooked; she cleaned. She was there for her man and her children.
O'REILLY: Yes.
PANGONAS: And she had a 22-inch waist.
O'REILLY: I didn't know that. What you learn here on "The Factor." Any downside here for you?
PANGONAS: Not yet. Look at me. I'm on national T.V. So I'm very, very excited. My children are very supportive. Also, I have 12, 10, 5, and 3. My husband's a captain in the Navy. So he says go for it.
O'REILLY: OK, Kelly, what happens now. Do you guys have a big pageant, and what's the wrap-up on this?
HEYNIGER: Yes, I believe they're trying to find a hot mom from the top cities. And once they do, they will have a big come-together of hot moms and have the ultimate hot mom contest.
PANGONAS: Hi, Kelly.
O'REILLY: It's hard to argue with that.
HEYNIGER: Hi, Traci.
O'REILLY: I'm glad I could bring you guys together.
PANGONAS: I know I haven't seen her since we competed.
O'REILLY: Yes, I haven't seen her either.
I want to point out that Kelly was Mrs. South Carolina. Were you living in South Carolina, by the way, Kelly, there?
HEYNIGER: Yes, I was living in South Carolina. It was in 2001.
O'REILLY: All right, that's good to hear. OK. So, ladies we wish you the best. We hope that you're hot continually, if that's what you want, and thanks for coming on "The Factor".
HEYNIGER: Thank you.
