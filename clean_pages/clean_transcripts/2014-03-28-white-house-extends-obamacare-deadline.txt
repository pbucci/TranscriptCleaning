O'REILLY: And in the "Impact Segment" tonight, as you may know the Obama administration now says the individual mandate to buy Obamacare health insurance will be extended. But just a few weeks ago, the administration was saying this.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
BRADY: Are you going to delay the mandate that individuals have to buy government approved healthcare or pay a tax?
SEBELIUS: No, sir.
BRADY: Are you going to delay the open enrollment beyond March 31st?
SEBELIUS: No, sir.

DAVID GREGORY, NBC NEWS HOST: Can you rule out the idea that the President doesn't delay the individual mandate?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes I can.
GREGORY: You can't that will not happen.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That will not happen?

O'REILLY: Now, last night on "SPECIAL REPORT", Charles Krauthammer used the "l" word.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: They were lying when they said it wouldn't change, the deadline wouldn't change. Everyone knew they were lying. And now nobody is surprised that they are lying and nobody really cares about it apparently.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: And joining us now from New Orleans to reply Democratic strategist James Carville. I might tell everybody that Mr. Carville believes Obamacare is good for the nation, will eventually work and has said that repeatedly on this program so there's no need to say it again because everybody knows that.
However, what I do want to say is that Charles Krauthammer came flat out and said they lied. That means intentionally. A lie is when you know you are uttering a falsehood not that circumstances changed.
JAMES CARVILLE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right.
O'REILLY: And the evidence is pretty tough that maybe they were lying. And you say?
CARVILLE: I say that what they said was if you had gone to enroll prior to -- March 31st or before that, they'll extend it for two weeks. If I tell my students at Tulane absolutely due on Monday and they come to me and said Professor Carville I started working on it and it's taking a little longer. And I said look ok I'll give to you until Tuesday. Did I lie maybe? I changed my mind.
O'REILLY: All right they changed their mind.
CARVILLE: These are for people that change their mind.
O'REILLY: Ok if I'm the teacher in Tulane because it costs so much money to go there. I impose discipline on the students and I say the paper is due this date and you are going to have it on this day.
CARVILLE: Right.
O'REILLY: And if you can't I'm going to take a couple of grades off your paper.
CARVILLE: Right.
O'REILLY: That's what I do. Ok now so --
CARVILLE: That might make me a weak teacher. But it wouldn't make me a liar just making the guy to change their mind.
O'REILLY: And I can't with a good conscience call Kathleen Sebelius or Mr. Plouffe "liars". I don't know what was in their mind. Now, Charles feels strongly and he did. I can't do it.
CARVILLE: Right.
O'REILLY: But I can say that this is the 38th change in Obamacare.
CARVILLE: Sure.
O'REILLY: 38.
CARVILLE: Right.
O'REILLY: All right? In a law that was passed by Congress.
CARVILLE: Right.
O'REILLY: And that is a farce. I can use the "f" word, farce. Go.
CARVILLE: My answer is that Congress allowed for these changes because it's very difficult. If you look at the history of the rollout of Medicare Part D President Bush did the same thing. And you're right. This thing has had a lot of (inaudible) and starts. It was a disastrous opening. But my point here is that basically on the whole the thing is starting to move in the right direction. But you're right --
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: All right. But they had three years to get it at least under control and they couldn't. All right, look. You are right it may work. You may be right, Carville, you very rarely are but in this case you might.
All right in the AP poll today, 59 percent of Americans believe the President is doing a poor job.
CARVILLE: Right.
O'REILLY: That is the highest ever for the Associated Press. I understand 17 people fainted over there when that number came in because you know how left wing the AP is. What is driving the poll numbers down for the President?
CARVILLE: Well, I think it's a combination of things. I think first there's still some leg on the rollout of Affordable Care Act. So I think people will say gee, they blame him directly there seems to be some disorder in the world.
And number three you and I have talked about this endlessly is that the fruits of the so-called recovery have yet to reach the middle class on down. It's just a recovery for the top one percent in this country and I think that the President is the guy in charge and to some extent they have that feeling.
On the other side, I don't know how important it is. He is not going to run for office again. And --
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: That's important for the Democratic Party though next fall because the President is a standard bearer. But I'm not going to disagree with your analysis. I think the people if you want to sum it up are running out of patience with President Obama. He is in his sixth year now.
And also, when you see a guy like Putin doing what he is doing, making America look weak, that -- a lot of people are very uneasy about that.
CARVILLE: You know, the thing about polling numbers is the go down and they go up.
O'REILLY: But he's been down now for a year. He's been straight down for a year.
CARVILLE: Well you know I think, I think they have been down a little bit, they been down particularly since October. But I would be surprised that if the recovery gains in momentum and as the news on this healthcare thing continues to improve they might come up between a tick or two. And maybe between nine of November and it might not be the disaster people are predicting. But I don't know that I'm giving you honest answer. I don't know that.
O'REILLY: The Chicago Cubs might win the pennant but we don't really expect that to happen. All right now I bet you a dinner and I want it at the Commander's Palace. I want to run up a humongous tab on you Carville.
CARVILLE: Oh my goodness.
O'REILLY: That Mary Landrieu will be defeated for the U.S. Senate. So I want to remind you of that bet.
CARVILLE: You're on.
O'REILLY: Ok but here is a yes or no answer because I only have 30 seconds.
CARVILLE: All right.
O'REILLY: If you were advising Mary Landrieu, would you bring in President Obama to campaign for her in Louisiana?
CARVILLE: Probably not.
O'REILLY: Ok. All right. You are an honest man. Save your money. Ok? I'm not going --
CARVILLE: We got our dinner at Commander's Palace.
O'REILLY: Ok James Carville everybody.
CARVILLE: All right deal.
