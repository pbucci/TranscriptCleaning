Once again, I'm going to keep this very short because we have a major policy interview with Sarah Palin this evening.
But did you know the Associated Press, America's largest news wire service, used 11 reporters to check the accuracy of Sarah Palin's book "Going Rogue"? Eleven.
Barack Obama has had two best-selling books. The Associated Press did not fact-check either one.
AP spokesman Paul Colford says that's because then-Senator Obama wasn't a major player when his books came out. Even if you believe that flimsy excuse, once he did become a presidential contender, shouldn't the AP have fact-checked his books?
I know I am beating a dead industry here, but the blatant left-wing bias of the American press has reached critical mass. It is simply out of control.
Even if you don't like Sarah Palin, you know she has been treated unfairly by the media. It shouldn't be happening.
And that's "The Memo."
Pinheads & Patriots
In Portland, Oregon, a father and son were about to get off mass transit when disaster struck. Somehow the 3-year-old boy got out of the train, but his father did not and rolled away. You can imagine the boy's fear.
Well, a kind woman comforted Aiden Bailey until his dad Aaron could make his way back. The lady is still unidentified, but she is quite a patriot.
On the pinhead front, say hello to Martha Stewart, who is commenting on her rival Rachael Ray:

MARTHA STEWART: She professed that she cannot bake. She just did a new cookbook which is just a re-edit of a lot of her old recipes, and that's not good enough for me. I mean, I really want to write a book that is a unique and lasting thing, something that will really fulfill a need in someone's library. So she's different. She's more of an entertainer with a bubbly personality than she is a teacher. She's a totally different kind of cook than I am. I don't know if she has a garden. I don't think so.

That sounds a little catty to us, so Ms. Stewart might be a pinhead.
