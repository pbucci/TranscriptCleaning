BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "At Your Beck and Call" segment tonight: Perhaps no one in the country has been more vilified in the left-wing media than our pal Glenn Beck, but he is not alone. Yesterday on MSNBC, conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart was subjected to this:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARTIN BASHIR, MSNBC HOST: This week, Marilyn Davenport, Republican official in Orange County, sent an e-mail to a number of colleagues featuring President Obama dressed in a family of apes.
ANDREW BREITBART, CONSERVATIVE BLOGGER: Are you asking me about this? What do I have to do with that?
BASHIR: I want to ask you what do you think of that?

BREITBART: It's deplorable. It's deplorable; it's reprehensible. And you are trying to -- you're trying to insinuate that I'm a racist here, which is what MSNBC does to conservatives every single day. This entire context of this conversation is what the NAACP and what the Democratic Party has been doing to the Tea Party for the last year.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
GLENN BECK, FOX NEWS HOST: This guy is so…

O'REILLY: Does Mr. Breitbart -- wait a minute, relax. So does Mr. Breitbart have a point? Here now, the aforementioned Glenn Beck. You couldn't wait.

BECK: No. I mean, I just thought we were having a conversation. I forgot.

O'REILLY: Yes, I know, and it's outrageous.
BECK: Breitbart is absolutely fearless. Fearless. I mean, he's a little like you. Walks right into the lion's den and you are like what are you doing here? What's going on?
O'REILLY: Yes, but I don't know if that's a smart thing to do because you don't really convert many people over there. But let's just deal with the -- you invite a guy on, Breitbart. You can talk about his website all day long. I mean, he's got a long history of -- and then you bring in something that he has nothing to do with.
BECK: Nothing to do with it.
O'REILLY: Right.
BECK: And you're not even talking about -- I mean, look, that photo is reprehensible. Everybody…
O'REILLY: Everybody knows.
BECK: Everybody knows it's reprehensible.
O'REILLY: So why would you even pose the question?
BECK: Right. And yet, why are you not talking about real things that are going on? If you want to bring real things that are going on…
O'REILLY: But that's my point.
BECK: …MSNBC…
O'REILLY: You know Breitbart -- but look, this goes to trying to humiliate conservatives. It's trying to attack them and brand them and Breitbart had it. He got teed off because -- what do I have to do with this? What are you throwing this at me for?
BECK: This is why -- this is why I think this whole thing is just not going to -- it's just not going to stand. You know, this, like MSNBC, I mean, how long does that going -- how long does that stay in business like that?
O'REILLY: I don't know. I mean, the ratings are abysmal. I don't know how long they go.
BECK: There's -- there's nothing -- there's nothing there.

O'REILLY: Comcast is a good company.
BECK: Yes.

O'REILLY: I don't know how long they go. All right, now, I heard a rumor that you were praising me on your radio program.
BECK: That's not true. I'm not…
O'REILLY: I mean, that couldn't possibly be.

BECK: No, you're right.

O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: It wasn't true at all.
O'REILLY: So you're trashing me as usual?
BECK: What was I -- what -- what could I possibly…

O'REILLY: It's about the economy and something…
BECK: Oh, America. I'm on tour last week. I'm out in the hinterlands, and I walk off stage -- I think I was in North Carolina -- I walk off stage. It's like 11:00 at night. Somebody hands me a piece of paper and says you have to read Mr. O'Reilly's "Talking Points." And I read Mr. O'Reilly's "Talking Points," and they say -- are you ready for this? -- I think there is a chance that these people are actually trying to destroy our economy.
O'REILLY: Yes, Soros and his merry men.
BECK: Bill…
O'REILLY: Krugman.
BECK: Give me a hug.
O'REILLY: No hugging.
BECK: Let's hug it out. Come on, hug me. Hug me.
O'REILLY: No, that would be impossible.
BECK: Hug me, hug me.
O'REILLY: No. Get back. I'll tell you. I'll shoot you.
BECK: I am going to hug him later.
O'REILLY: OK. Now, you and I have debated this and, you know, when you get to a point where a $14-plus trillion deficit then you have people saying no -- like Soros said -- we couldn't have more debt than a good economy.
BECK: Right.
O'REILLY: And then you go, OK, look, it's beyond any kind of -- I do believe that there are elements -- Soros, Krugman, people like that -- who want to destroy the economy so they can build up a socialistic system.
BECK: Well, let me ask you this. Ben Bernanke is one of the smartest guys. We did a whole hour on tonight's show at 5:00 on the Fed. Ben Bernanke, a brilliant guy, right?
O'REILLY: Yes.

BECK: It's not working. QE1, QE2, the stimulus, TARP -- it doesn't work. It doesn't work.
O'REILLY: Well we're slowly coming out of this recession.
BECK: We have lost 20 percent -- in the last eight years, your dollar has lost 20 percent in value. Do you have the chart of oil? Look at this chart of oil. OK. The dollar is the green.
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: Oil, the price of oil is the red.
O'REILLY: Right.
BECK: It's almost a mirror image. What happens is the dollar is pegged or the oil is pegged to the dollar. So as they devalue our dollar, the price of oil goes up.
O'REILLY: Right, because they want more dollars to get more buying power, the sheiks and the cartels.
BECK: But -- but it doesn't -- but it doesn't -- yes, it doesn't work for us. It doesn't work for the American people.
O'REILLY: OK. OK. But Bernanke has to basically keep interest rates low to hope that the consumerism drives the economy up.
BECK: Everyone all around the world says we are insane for what we're doing. We are intentionally…
O'REILLY: All right. I'm not going to go that far. But I will say…
BECK: All I'm asking you to say is that maybe the Fed doesn't have our best interest at heart.
O'REILLY: I'm not going to do that because I'm not sure about that.
BECK: There are -- OK, let me ask you this. There are private corporations, right?
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: Everybody is shouting about corporations and banks. There are a private corporation of banks that we don't even know who they are.

O'REILLY: That the government hires to try to make sure that the currency doesn't…

BECK: No, no, the government hires, do they really? You know this as well as I do. The Fed chair -- the president walks in and says hey, the Fed chair, here are your three choices, Mr. President: this little pig, this little pig and this little pig.
O'REILLY: Right.
BECK: The president can't say, "I want this one over here." "No, no, it's this one." Who works for who?
O'REILLY: No, they are independent. They're independent. But I don't see them as in some kind of collusion to damage the American economy, the Fed. I just don't see it. I do see…
BECK: Give me time, America. We got him to the destroying of…
O'REILLY: I don't see. I go as far as the evidence takes me. One good news though…
BECK: Yes.
O'REILLY: …that Obama told Holder, the attorney general to start investigating some of these speculators who are manipulating the prices.
BECK: You mean speculators -- you mean people like…
O'REILLY: Oil speculators.

BECK: OK, so like hedge funds.
O'REILLY: Like Soros.
BECK: Like Soros, yes.
O'REILLY: Investigate him.
BECK: Oh, they are going right after Soros. Mark my words.

O'REILLY: No.

BECK: The speculators are completely unregulated. Why are these hedge funds completely unregulated? Why?
O'REILLY: I don't know. They should be regulated and perhaps they will be.
BECK: Yes.
O'REILLY: All right. There's Glenn Beck, everybody.
BECK: The little bunny -- little bunny rabbits fly out of my pants.
O'REILLY: We do agree. All right, it's Easter time.
BECK: Yes, that's why I'm using it.
