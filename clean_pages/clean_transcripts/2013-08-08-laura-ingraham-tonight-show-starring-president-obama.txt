The same week our government took the unprecedented action of shuttering 19 of our embassies in response to what we've been told was a serious and credible threat of terrorism, the President sat down with funny man Jay Leno. Bypassing the White House Press Corps he used the popular late night show to make his first public comments on the new global terror threat.

OBAMA: For all progress we have made, getting bin Laden, putting al Qaeda between Afghanistan and Pakistan back on its heels, that you know, this radical, you know, violent extremism is still out there.
And we've got to -- you know, we've got to stay on top of it. Terrorists depend on the idea that we're going to be terrorized. And we - - we're going to live our lives and the odds of people dying in a terrorist attack, obviously are still a lot lower than in a car accident, unfortunately.
LENO: Sure. Sure.

INGRAHAM: That's reassuring.
And of course, Jay Leno is an entertainer and a darn good one. His job isn't to ask a logical follow up to that like maybe saying, "Wait during the election you said al Qaeda was on the run, sir." Or "Are these embassy closings an overreaction, perhaps, spurred by the lingering questions over your handling of Benghazi, Mr. President?"
Well, the President also spoke about Russia's potential mistreatment of gays at the Olympics and about Edward Snowden. And it was Leno whose job again is to entertain not to grill elected officials the President knew he would not be asked about the failed reset with Russia or maybe about why a contractor like Snowden ever had access to information like this in the first place.
If they weren't still so enamored with Mr. Obama, Washington journalists would be kicking up a huge fuss about this. The President has submitted to fewer press conferences than every President since Reagan.
In his first term, check this out. George W. Bush had done 89 press conferences, Clinton 133 and Obama, only 79. The fact is, President Obama never stopped being in campaign mode and that was evident last night. It's the only thing he's really done well.
So shall we look forward to another slow jam with Jimmy Fallon during the debt ceiling debate? Anything he says in this type of forum, as entertaining as it might be, ends up being trivialized. Part of a nonstop "celebutaiment" industry that dumbs-down serious issues and insulates the President from proper journalistic inquiry.
And that's "The Memo."
