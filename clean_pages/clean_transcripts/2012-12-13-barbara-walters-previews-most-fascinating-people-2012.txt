O'REILLY: Second "Personal Story" segment tonight, "The Most Fascinating People of 2012," according to Barbara Walters. Her yearly special on the subject airs tonight on ABC.
Here's the list. Hillary Clinton, Ben Affleck, Seth MacFarlane, Chris Christie, Honey Boo Boo, author E.L. James who writes with the S&M stuff, Gabby Douglas, and the pop group, One Direction.
Here now, Barbara Walters. So, who gave you the best sound byte.
BARBARA WALTERS, BROADCAST JOURNALIST: Right. I want to comment on something your people were just talking about, whether Hillary Clinton is going to run or not.
She is one of our "10 Most Fascinating People." Let me read you what she said from the mouth and not just --
O'REILLY: Sure.
WALTERS: OK. Here we go. She says, "It's all hypothetical because, right now, I have no intention of running."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
"I just want to make a contribution. Will it be political? I don't think so. I think it will be philanthropic. It might be academic. It might be business."
So, you'll know much more about her tonight.
O'REILLY: Well, my money is on she's running. Will you bet me.
WALTERS: Oh, OK. I'm telling you what she said. No, I like to get the facts. You like to do conjecture.
O'REILLY: Yes. But I put my money where my mouth is. I'll bet you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALTERS: I don't bet. I come on because I love you. I don't come on to make money.
(LAUGHTER)
If I bet you, I'll win.
O'REILLY: Oh, you're saying that she were -- you know she's going to run. OK, on these fascinating people things, do you pick them or somebody else pick them.
WALTERS: No. Bill Geddie and I, who's our executive producer --
O'REILLY: Geddie? You're with Bill Geddie?
WALTERS: Yes, Bill Geddie. You know, the executive producer on "The View."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: He's a very troubled person.
WALTERS: "The View" has made you famous.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: You have made me famous? I'm never -- I'm not on his fascinating list. Look at Christie. Does he look fascinating?
(LAUGHTER)
WALTERS: You know something?
O'REILLY: Wait. Look at his -- look how he's looking at you. He doesn't like you. He doesn't like you, look.
WALTERS: Well, he didn't like me in part because I asked about his weight. But we also asked him about his promoting -- you know, praising Obama. And that's --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Yes. Got him elected.
WALTERS: Well, he did not get him -- he says that he didn't -- when you see the piece, that he did more campaigning than anybody else besides Mitt Romney.
You know what happened to Mitt Romney. And he doesn't want to -- didn't want to run now, but he talks about 2016.
O'REILLY: Is he running.
WALTERS: He didn't have the fire in his belly now. But I would be willing to bet you the whole nine yards in 2016.
O'REILLY: OK. So, you would --
WALTERS: I'll bet you.
O'REILLY: I don't know anything but, no, Christie -- I think he wants it. I think he wants it. So, would you like to see a Christie versus Hillary. That'd be fun.
WALTERS: I think that would be --
O'REILLY: You know, that'd be really fun. All right, Barack Obama, he's the President. He doesn't make the Fascinating list though. He's not a fascinating person.
WALTERS: Well, we've had both the President and the First Lady on --
O'REILLY: Yes. But, look, let's be honest. When it comes down between Barack Obama and Honey Boo Boo, you've got to go with Boo Boo. You've got to go with her.
(LAUGHTER)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
Thank you, appreciate that. I got a laugh out of her. Right. There's Honey Boo Boo. There she is. She's the new Secretary of State. Did you know that.
WALTERS: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
Why do I do this show.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: That's what everybody says.
WALTERS: I want to ask you a question.
O'REILLY: What.
WALTERS: When one of the people we talked to in "Ten Most Fascinating People" is E.L. James who's the woman who wrote "Fifty Shades" --
O'REILLY: Yes, the S&M woman.
WALTERS: Well, she says it's love story, "Fifty Shades of Gray."
O'REILLY: Yes, OK.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WALTERS: And she talked about the fact that it is love story and that women like to be submissive. Do you think women like to be submissive.
O'REILLY: No.
WALTERS: You don't.
O'REILLY: I've been on "The View." So, I don't think so, all right.
(LAUGHTER)
WALTERS: Which made you a star.
O'REILLY: Oh, yes. It made me a star. OK, all of these people are - -
WALTERS: I only said that because you tell me that if you mention my program, it will be a success. Otherwise, it wouldn't make it.
O'REILLY: It will be, all right. Look, you have a nice, eclectic crew there and I think you'd get a good rating with it. Barack Obama, you know, the word is that he's now really -- and I think this may be true, he's a little cockier than he used to be, now that he got re-elected.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
Did you see that when you sat down with him. Now, you're interview with him is going to be on "20/20" on Friday, right.
WALTERS: "20/20." Barack Obama, the word is he's now really -- I think this may be true -- he's a little cockier than he used to be now that they got re-elected.
Did you see a change in his demeanor.
WALTERS: He seemed to me --
O'REILLY: Be honest, be honest, be honest.
WALTERS: No, I'm thinking about it. We did an interview with him alone which was when he talked about the Syrian rebels and that he's going to recognize them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
And then we did an interview with him with Mrs. Obama where he is very relaxed and very funny.
O'REILLY: So, he was tensed just with you. And when she came in, he was more relaxed.
WALTERS: He is comfortable with himself now. I don't think -- I think --
O'REILLY: You didn't see he was a little cockier? You didn't see he was a little more self-assured? No?
WALTERS: I don't find him cocky when he's with her. I find them very funny and they spar together. And it's a different Barack Obama. It's much more personal.
Did I find him cocky? No, I didn't. No.
O'REILLY: No, you didn't.
WALTERS: You, I find cocky. Him, I don't find cocky.
O'REILLY: No, I know. But I'm not any cockier than I was five years ago. The word in Washington is he's a little bit more, he's a little bit more, "Hey, in your face. I won again. Don't mess with me."
WALTERS: I'd like to know -- you know, it depends. All these people who know everything, who haven't interviewed him or haven't talked to Hillary.
Everybody is in authority. I did not find him cocky. I found him --
O'REILLY: You like him though, right.
WALTERS: I do like him.
O'REILLY: Do you think he's been a good president?
WALTERS: I find him -- when he talks about --
O'REILLY: You're dodging.
WALTERS: I'm trying to finish my sentence which is --
O'REILLY: You're dodging me. Has he been a good president.
WALTERS: -- which is more than you left those other two women do 10 minutes ago.
O'REILLY: Oh, yes. You're out of control.
WALTERS: They didn't get a word in.
O'REILLY: Oh, stop.
WALTERS: Where was I. I've already forgotten.
O'REILLY: Was Barack -- Is Barack Obama a good president.
WALTERS: In my opinion?
O'REILLY: Yes.
WALTERS: Yes, I think he has been a good president.
O'REILLY: OK. We respect that. We respect that.
WALTERS: Thank you.
O'REILLY: You know you'll be paying more to the government though, right. I hope you've been setting aside a little of that "View" money.
WALTERS: I am very blessed. And so are you. And if it helps this country, and if it helps pay for the many of the things we need, I don't mind paying more taxes. And you shouldn't either.
O'REILLY: I don't mind paying unless it's wasted on things like Solyndra and things like that. That upsets me.
WALTERS: Well, that's one thing and you keep bringing it up.
O'REILLY: OK. And I don't want Honey Boo Boo getting any of my money. Barbara Walters, "Fascinating People," ABC.
WALTERS: Happy Holidays.
O'REILLY: I don't know why you come in here. Because I'm the only one in the world that gives a hard --
WALTERS: Because I -- you know what, because I love you.
O'REILLY: Yes. I'm the only one who gives you a hard time in the world.
WALTERS: You know I love you.
O'REILLY: In the whole world, the only one.
WALTERS: Happy Holidays, my darling, Bill.
O'REILLY: Merry Christmas.
WALTERS: Merry Christmas.
