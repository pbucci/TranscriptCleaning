Big Hollywood fundraiser for Senator Barack Obama last night [Tuesday, Feb. 20]. Jennifer Aniston, Eddie Murphy, Natalie Maines, hundreds of others forked over $2,300 to support Obama's presidential run. As I mentioned last night, I tried to buy a ticket! I had my money out! But Obama's people said no. No way, no how is O'Reilly getting in. So I sent my guys, led by producer Ron Mitchell, to check things out.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hi.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, hi, I work for the Bill O'Reilly. And we tried to buy a ticket to the event. And they wouldn't sell us one.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is not a press event.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, I understand. We tried to buy the ticket. They wouldn't sell us one. I figure we'd like to come in and try to talk to people and.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sorry, we're totally sold out. We are not allowing any press within the event.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Interesting. That's too bad.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you could turn off your camera, please, for me?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. And where should we leave -- where should we go?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're going to have to leave.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I am staying at the hotel.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And that gives you the right to be here in the lobby?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I did order my breakfast already. OK, sure.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That gives you the right to be in the guest rooms.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But not.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not beyond this point.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you turn the camera off, it would be greatly appreciated.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, thank you.

Now not only was “The Factor” booted, but all the other media as well. And they were not pleased.
This is almost unheard of. Most politicians want press exposure, especially because there was no Q & A. It was just Obama bloviating. So why didn't he want to you to hear him?
The answer to that question is, ready, Elvis Presley. Let me explain. Back in the mid-50s, Presley's manager Colonel Tom Parker marketed him to the country as a charismatic, polite young man who could sing.
And as we all know, Elvis rose to become the most popular entertainer in the world, but few knew anything about him. It was all image and songs. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is Obama's strategy.
His handlers are marketing him. He's running on two issues: get out of Iraq and government funded healthcare for all. Everything else is general and undefined.
Like Elvis, the Senator is charismatic. And while he can't sing, he can talk. Pardon me, but I'm going to say it. Obama is articulate.
So that's the strategy. Market Obama in a general way. Rely on his charisma and keep the press away. The question is: will it work?
And that's "The Memo."
Most Ridiculous Item
Thank God I didn't have to report on Anna Nicole Smith this evening. -- I understand why people are interested. I just hate the story.
But, there was this said in court today:

VIRGIE ARTHUR, MOTHER OF ANNA NICOLE SMITH: Howard is the one that lives off of Vickie Lynn. I don't do that to Vickie Lynn.
JUDGE LARRY SEIDLIN, BROWARD COUNTY: We don't want to do this. I tried to stay away from this. I tried to stay away from this.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Counsel wants to turn this point of the trial into more of a circus than it is.
SEIDLIN: There's no circus here, my friend. There's no circus here.

There's no circus here, judge? Are you kidding? Here's a clue. The clowns have been unleashed. And it may be ridiculous.
