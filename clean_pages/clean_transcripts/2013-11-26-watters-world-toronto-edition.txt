O'REILLY: "Watter's World Segment" tonight, as you may know, there is chaos in Toronto, Canada. Its mayor, Rob Ford running wild, admitted to smoking crack and out of control behavior in general. So we sent Watters up to Canada where he tracked down the Mayor.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Mayor Ford, you're in a bit of trouble up here.
FORD: We'll see around October 27th if I'm in trouble or not.
WATTERS: You're running for reelection.
WATTERS: Absolutely.
WATTES: Marion Berry smoked crack and got reelected. Have you reached out to him?
FORD: No, no -- I haven't reached out to anyone.
WATTERS: Your behavior has been a little erratic.
FORD: Can you get off my property please.
WATTERS: What's going on?
FORD: Did I go out and party sometimes? Yes sure. I'm only human.
WATTERS: You partied a little harder than most people.
FORD: I wouldn't say that. Some people would say --
WATTERS: And most people don't smoke crack when they party.
FORD: On a Friday night, if I know I have nothing planned the next day, maybe once every two months, which it usually is, Yes ok I'll drink and have a big party.
WATTERS: Cut loose.
FORD: Cut loose.
WATTERS: Do you smoke crack?
FORD: No, I don't smoke crack.
WATERS: You did that one time?
FORD: Yes absolutely I didn't have to say that. I came up and said it and then they started dropping all of these videos.
And then the police are following me around with claims and I've never been charged. This is the biggest coup that you have ever seen in North America. Am I politically crap? No. Am I a little rough around the edges? Absolutely. I call a spade a spade.
WATTERS: Do you think that judgment, what you did, will reflect poorly on your decision-making as mayor though.
FORD: I have not missed one day, in 13 years, of being elected official down here.
WATTERS: The late night comics in the United States are killing you right now.

JON STEWART, COMEDY CENTRAL HOST: This (bleep) guy is a one-man episode of Cops.
(LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Do you listen to any of that.
FORD: Well, I don't really -- I'm watching NFL. I'm watching hockey. I'm a big hockey fan.
WATTERS: You're not an Obama supporter, are you.
FORD: No. No, no, no, no. I'm not a lefty, I'm a righty. Come on, some of the stuff you guys are doing down there. To me -- are you crazy. With the way you --
WATTERS: ObamaCare?
FORD: God, it sounds crazy.
WATTERS: You're not an ObamaCare supporter.
FORD: Come on.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Now, the woman who you barreled over at the city council meeting, is she okay.
FORD: No, I didn't barrel her over.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
It sounds like you're a lefty. They have paid protesters, that council. I looked over. My brother's there. And I saw her like being surrounded by Bison's (ph) guys.
I tried to smoke it through. And she was in the way. I accidentally bumped her and I grabbed her.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Are you having fun right now.
FORD: I'm loving it.
WATTERS: You're liking this.
FORD: I'm loving this. My record speaks for itself. I apologize for my mistakes.
I'm only human. I can't change the past. What it is, it is.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: He is. He's loving this. What about the consequences, are there any.
And how do the good folks who live in Toronto see all this. Roll the tape.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 1: He was a drunkard at the party that everyone thinks should leave, and doesn't.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 2: His use of illicit drugs bothers me.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JEFF COHEN, ACTOR: It's the most amazing thing I ever saw.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 3: His behavior is detrimental. But this is his personal behavior. It's nothing to do with the country.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 2: he probably dabbled in it once or twice.
WATTERS: Crack.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 2: A drug, yes.
WATTERS: It's kind of a big deal. Is crack legal.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 3: It's not legal. Marijuana isn't legal as well.
WATTERS: Marijuana is a little different than crack. Well, it isn't.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

(END VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 4: I've smoked a lot of weed. I'm pretty fried.
WATTERS: Do you think smoking meth is a good idea.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 5: If you smoke meth once or twice a month, it actually kind of resurrect you if you'd actually sit there and hyperfocus on some stuff.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: Right, as usual, sir.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: I'm going to have to pat you down here. Spread them. Spread them.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 2: No, I think he should step down.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE 3: I think it's time for him to quit. He's got problems.
WATTERS: Do you think the press has been too tough on the mayor.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE 3: Absolutely. Let's give him a chance. This is all political.
They're just wanting him out of the office. And, now, they found a reason to.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RICK MORANIS, ACTOR: OK, so I'll see you later, huh. I'll give you a call.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: That's not nice.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(END VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: And, now, you have to go.
(LAUGHTER)
All right, here's Watters. The consensus on the streets?
WATTERS: I think 60-40, they're against Mayor Ford. But they like his policies.
O'REILLY: Right.
WATTERS: He came in and he cut taxes, --
O'REILLY: Right.
WATTERS: -- he wants to clean things up.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
He resonates with the average guy.
O'REILLY: Now, Ford himself, why did he bother to talk to you. Does he have any idea who you are, or what I do, what we do here.
WATTERS: I don't think he's ever really heard of "The Factor."
O'REILLY: No.
WATTERS: It's funny, the guy who set up the interview, the Chief of Staff, --
O'REILLY: Yes.
WATTERS: He actually got canned after the interview.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Because they had to cut the budget for the poor mayor's staff.
O'REILLY: Oh, is that right.
WATTERS: A little awkward after that.
O'REILLY: Yes, when you're spending all your money on drugs, there's not a lot left for salaries.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: That's not nice. That's not nice.
O'REILLY: Look, he looks to me like an OK guy guy.
WATTERS: He's a great guy.
O'REILLY: Right.
WATTERS: He's a good old boy.
O'REILLY: But he should be out on a cruise ship or something.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Yes, he needs a detox a little bit.
O'REILLY: Right, not holding public office.
WATTERS: Oh, you know what, he says he doesn't have an alcohol problem. He says he just needs to hit the gym, so he hires a personal trainer. And the day after, this personal trainer is linked to a steroid scandal.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: All right.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: So, trouble just follows this guy.
O'REILLY: He looks like he's on steroids.
(LAUGHTER)
You know, Watters, that I'm right pretty much all the time, right.
WATTERS: 99.8.
O'REILLY: Now, that's why Watters has his job, because he says things like that. Hispanics, Juan Williams, --
WATTERS: Yes.
O'REILLY: -- latest poll, all right, 47 percent of Hispanic voters disapprove, 41 percent approve. Juan --
WATTERS: So, they said --
O'REILLY: Juan should buy us both dinner I think.
WATTERS: I think so.
O'REILLY: You think so.
WATTERS: I'm going to order the steak and the lobster.
O'REILLY: All right, all right. You tell Juan he owes us both. And you just get it because you're doing -- you know.
