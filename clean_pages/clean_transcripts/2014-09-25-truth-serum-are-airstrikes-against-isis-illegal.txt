O'REILLY: "Truth Serum" segment tonight. Is bombing Syria a violation of international law as Putin says? And did Nancy Pelosi tell the truth when she said this?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As a whole, this has been called again and again a do nothing Congress. 142 bills passed into law by this Congress down from 906 in 1948, famously also do nothing Congress.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: So you can imagine how nothing this is.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But do you feel some culpability lies with Democrats for that?
PELOSI: No, I don't at all.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: None?
PELOSI: Let me just say that any of this equivalents of both sides this or that. No. We never treated President Bush the way they treat President Obama.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Wow. Here now to report on the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Ace Fox News correspondents Molly Line and Eric Shawn. So, what about Mrs. Pelosi? You know, is there anything to what she says that Democrats didn't treat President Bush like they treat -- Republicans treat Obama?
ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS ANCHOR SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: You know, Bill, if you are a president, you are going to be a punching bag.
O'REILLY: Absolutely.
SHAWN: I think that she is suffering from some selective amnesia. I know she hasn't been around since 1864. But in that election, George McClelland the Democrat, against one of the greatest presidents of the United States Abraham Lincoln called Abraham Lincoln a well-meaning baboon.
O'REILLY: Yeah.
SHAWN: So, this is - this is - this is part of the Republic.
O'REILLY: Let us amplify Sean's point by rolling this tape.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PELOSI: Bless his heart. The president of the United States, a total failure, losing all credibility with the American people on the economy, on the war, on energy, you name the subject.
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: He hasn't been somebody that listens to other people. We all know the swagger and his arrogance.
REP. PETE STARK (D-CA), FORMER CONGRESSMAN: President Bush's statements about children's health shouldn't be taken any more seriously than his lies about the war in Iraq. The truth is that Bush just likes to blow things up.
PELOSI: I think it's a complete embarrassment to the Bush administration to have a piece of legislation out there that is so confusing they can't even explain it to anyone themselves.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: All right. Now even putting Mrs. Pelosi in your seat, where she watches herself, she still wouldn't say that she mislead everybody. Would she?
SHAWN: You know, what's also very big is calling the president a liar.
O'REILLY: Yes. That's what Stark did.
SHAWN: That's happened on both sides.
O'REILLY: Right.
SHAWN: Joe Wilson, remember the Congressman.
O'REILLY: He yelled it out! Absolutely!
SHAWN: He did that.
O'REILLY: So, each side does it and for Miss Pelosi to put out that the Democrats aren't as bad as Republicans is not really true.
SHAWN: It happens both ways. But if you can't stand the heat. Harry Truman said to get out of the kitchen.
O'REILLY: Harry Truman, everyone, as he made his waffle. All right Line, now it's your turn. Putin that Nobel Peace Prize candidate says that the United States bombing ISIS in Syria violates international law. Is Putin lying? What is he doing?
MOLLY LINE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, interesting, you start up kicking right off with who is leveling these accusations. Of course, we have Iran and Russia. Russia who a lot of people find that very rich. But they are so concerned about the sovereignty of another nation considering what we recently saw in Ukraine.
O'REILLY: Sure.
LINE: But the argument they are making is that for this to be legal on an international level for the strikes against ISIS in Syria, you would have to have either the permission of the Syrian government or permission from the U.N. Security Council. Now, it's true that the United States went in without the permission of Damascus. In other words, they informed Damascus .
O'REILLY: Yeah, Assad would .
LINE: that we're going to get this done. We are not cooperating with them.
O'REILLY: Right. Right.
LINE: We have this coalition of five other partners, Arab nations that have joined us in these hits. But, essentially the argument the U.S. makes for this being legal is one of self-defense. They cite article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which recognizes the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense. And they make these points in a letter. Drawing everything out. The U.S. ambassador sent to the U.N. Secretary -.
O'REILLY: Now, but here is what they did.
LINE: Secretary General.
O'REILLY: Here is what they did. They being Washington. You saw the little report about the al Qaeda group. I forget the name. They - first time I have ever saw .
LINE: Khorasan.
O'REILLY: It's very good. All right. Say it again.
LINE: The Khorasan group.
O'REILLY: The Khorasan group. And they said, you know what? They were making bombs to blow up the United States. That's why they did that. Now, I don't know about the Khorasan group. I don't know what they are doing. But that was the justification of what you just pointed out.
LINE: That's certainly part of the self-defense aspect of the ultimately .
O'REILLY: That's entirely what the self-defense thing is.
LINE: Right. And they make a collective argument about Iraq. And that's one of the most important parts of the letter is that Iraq made it clear it's facing this serious threat. Iraq made it very clear that they need help.
O'REILLY: Yeah, but the bottom line is the United States doesn't care what Syria says or what the United Nations, because so what? You can say whatever you want. But, the U.S. should declare war on the jihad and worldwide terrorism. Therefore, if they declare war, then the legal authority comes to us. All right. So that is the truth serum segment tonight. Thank you much.
LINE: Thank you.
O'REILLY: I appreciate it.
