22-year-old Australian baseball player Christopher Lane shot dead in Oklahoma last Friday for absolutely no reason at all. Mr. Lane had played for East Central University. He was out jogging when three thugs allegedly murdered him.
They are 15-year-old James Edwards, 16-year-old Chancey Luna and 17-year- old Michael Jones. Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford says the teenagers were all in trouble before and on the day of the shooting Edwards actually had a court appearance. Reaction to the horror is heartbreaking.

HARPER: He's such an amazing person and I'm going to miss him forever. But I'm really glad that I got the four years with him.
PETER LANE, FATHER OF CHRIS LANE: There wasn't anything he did or could have done. He was an athlete going for a jog like he would do. And I thought (ph) was six days a week in terms of his training schedule. So it's happened. It's wrong. And we just try and deal with it the best we can.

O'REILLY: And in Australia, there is deep anger against America.

FIM FISCHER, FORMER AUSTRALIAN DEPUTY PRESS MINISTER: People thinking of going to the USA on business or tourist trips should think carefully about it given the statistical fact you are 15 times more likely to be shot dead in the USA than in Australia per capita per a million people.

JASON HICKS, STEPHENS COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: To those friends of ours in Australia, we would say to you this is not Duncan, Oklahoma and I'm going to do everything that can I to ensure that we see these three thugs pay for what they did to Christopher Lane.

O'REILLY: Now, based upon known evidence, James Edwards could be the instigator. Information about Edwards on social media indicates he may be affiliated with the Crips Gang, that he wanted to be a rapper. That he appeared on a Web site posing with a rifle. The father of the teen reacted this way.

JAMES EDWARDS SR., FATHER OF MURDER SUSPECT: I feel that that he doesn't really matter. You know, he doesn't -- that he doesn't really understand it at all. He doesn't -- he really doesn't understand how serious it is.

O'REILLY: I find that hard to believe but police say Edwards was dancing and joking after he was arrested. His sister blames it on the community.

RACHEL PADILLA, SISTER OF MURDER SUSPECT: I would like for people to know in this community that if we would reach out to the youth and do more things with them this stuff could be prevented.

O'REILLY: Other reaction not much. The NAACP is silent. Civil rights industry largely silent some liberals blaming America's lack of gun control. Fox News White House correspondent Ed Henry got this reaction from President Obama's spokesman.

ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Trayvon Martin here and in the Rose Garden why hasn't he spoken out on this in this case?
There is a judicial proceeding and there was one in the Trayvon Martin case he spoke out extensively on that one.
JOSH EARNEST, DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Well I'm not sure that -- there are some people in this room I don't think would agree with you that the President spoke out extensively on it.

O'REILLY: "Talking Points" believes there is a destructive culture in this country. It is apparent that if convicted the three boys are have no regard for human life. Yet, he they had plenty regard for the social media, for rap, for X Box. The mother of Chancey Luna says the boy was playing that video game shortly before the murder occurred.
There will come a point in America when on as people will begin to see this problem for what it is a cultural collapse among some very distinct groups.
A violent subculture is now in place fueled by derelict parents, a barbaric media and apathy on the part of many politicians. The incredible violence taking place in some Chicago neighborhoods as well as mindless murderers all over the country prove this point. And until we acknowledge -- acknowledge the source of the chaos, we will not be able to solve the problem.
And that's "The Memo".
