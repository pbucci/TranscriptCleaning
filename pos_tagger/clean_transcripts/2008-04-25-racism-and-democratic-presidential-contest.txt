The far-left blogs are full of postings by loons saying that Pennsylvanians who did not vote for Barack Obama are racist, nonsense like that. But there is a serious racial issue now emerging in the campaign.
Earlier this week I was listening to a talk radio program hosted by a man named Joe Madison, aka "The Black Eagle." And a caller said that I, your humble correspondent, had been unfair to Barack Obama, apparently for reporting the Rev. Wright stuff.
So let me get this straight. In the eyes of some Americans, if you vote against Senator Obama or report anything negative about him, you're a racist. Wow.
In Pennsylvania, 97 percent of black men voted for Obama. Is there a racist component in that statistic? President Clinton says he was targeted by the Obama campaign, framed if you will, on racial issues. There is no question that race is becoming a central issue in the presidential race, and I expect that to continue.
Now to his credit, Barack Obama himself has not played the race card, but his response to a controversial campaign ad in North Carolina is interesting. First the ad.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For 20 years, Barack Obama sat in his pew listening to his pastor.
REV. JEREMIAH WRIGHT: And then wants us to sing "God Bless America." No, no, no. Not "God Bless America," God (EXPLETIVE) America.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Now Beth Perdue and Richard Moore endorse Barack Obama. They should know better. He's just too extreme for North Carolina.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The North Carolina Republican Party sponsored this ad opposing Beth Perdue and Richard Moore for North Carolina governor.

Now John McCain has asked the GOP in North Carolina to pull that ad.

JOHN MCCAIN: We communicated with them in the strongest possible terms to not run that ad. I do not — cannot in my role dictate to the North Carolina Republican Party what their message is, but I can condemn it.

Senator Obama, however, sees it differently.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA: I assume that if John McCain thinks that it's an inappropriate ad, that he can get them to pull it down since he's their nominee and standard-bearer.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Now that's a clever response from Senator Obama. He can now hang the ad around McCain's neck if he wants to.
So it's obvious that race will be a growing concern in the campaign. It will also be used as a club, as a method of intimidation. And it won't be pretty. But that's where we are in the political process.
And that's "The Memo."
Pinheads & Patriots
Seventy-four-year-old Willard Scott is still a force on morning television, and we like him.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now let's say hello to Willard Scott. Willard?
WILLARD SCOTT, "TODAY" SHOW CO-HOST: Always a pleasure to be here for Smuckers, and check out our buddies. Happy birthday, as we turn the jam jar around and it spins and spins. The spin stops here, Bill O'Reilly.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
For understanding the no-spin concept, Mr. Scott is a patriot.
On the pinhead front, one of "The View" ladies, Sherri Shepherd, is apparently voting for Barack Obama.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SHERRI SHEPHERD, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Your entire lifetime you've seen people in positions of power that look like you. I am — the first time in my life, I am seeing a man running who looks like me.
ELISABETH HASSELBECK, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": I have never seen a president that looks like me.
SHEPHERD: They look like you. They are white, and they look like you. I want to be able — it shows young black men that they can have a voice in politics. It shows my son Jeffrey that he can do the same thing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Well, we want Jeff to be encouraged by his country. I also believe Ms. Shepherd is a pinhead though, because no presidential vote should be color-based.
However, in general, Sherri does a good job. Come on. Stop the color stuff, all right? Everybody.
