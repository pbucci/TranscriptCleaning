(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: $150 billion to alternative energy in the Obama administration.
BARACK OBAMA: Yes. Over 10 years.
O'REILLY: OK. Over 10 years.
OBAMA: Yes.
O'REILLY: To what? What's it going to be?
OBAMA: Let me give you some examples. We have to extend tax credits for solar, wind, hydro. We just visited a hydro plant…
O'REILLY: But you're scattershooting it though. What if solar, wind and hydro don't work? You should get nukes involved. Why are you against nuclear energy? France and Sweden do it.
OBAMA: I am not against it.
O'REILLY: Let's get the plants up.
OBAMA: Well, OK. Why not?
O'REILLY: Let's start drilling in ANWR.
OBAMA: Who is arguing with you?
O'REILLY: Are you afraid? Are you afraid, scared?
OBAMA: ANWR, I think is a problem.
O'REILLY: What? A caribou is going to be scared? Come on. You're with the folks. They can't pay their heating bill, and you're worried about a caribou, wondering what's that doing?
OBAMA: Listen.
O'REILLY: What?
OBAMA: One of the great things about this country, we've got some beautiful real estate here.
O'REILLY: Come on. ANWR? You going to run shuttles up there?
OBAMA: We are lucky to have some of the most beautiful real estate on earth. And we want to make sure...
O'REILLY: You're making me cry here.
OBAMA: We want to make sure we pass it on to the next generation. But this notion that I'm opposed to nuclear power, it's just not true.

O'REILLY: Let's be honest. Both parties sold out the American people on energy. Both the Republicans and the Dems. You've been in the Senate for 21 years. There's no alternative energy system, and there's nothing under development until maybe a year ago. Clinton-Gore didn't do anything. They didn't do anything on global warming. They didn't do bupkis. American people have a right to be angry.
JOHN MCCAIN: I think it's because there's one fundamental problem, and that is that you have a cartel that controls all of the — virtually all of the world's oil supply.
O'REILLY: OPEC.
MCCAIN: And they obviously can set the price of oil at the highest level that will sustain it. And second of all, the United States of America must become independent first in Middle Eastern oil and then...
O'REILLY: It's going to take a while because we didn't do anything for the last three decades.
MCCAIN: I agree that we have not done enough.
(NEW VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: You're the Obama girl, right?
AMBER LEE ETTINGER, "OBAMA GIRL": Yes.
O'REILLY: OK. But you're not a political person. You don't care about that?
ETTINGER: I wouldn't say I wouldn't care. I wasn't too political and this definitely thrust me into the world of politics.
O'REILLY: And now you are famous in the Internet world. People know you. They know what you do. What do you do from here?
ETTINGER: Well, I'm going to still work for Barely Political.
O'REILLY: Stay on the Web site Barely Political.
ETTINGER: BarelyPolitical.com.
O'REILLY: They call it Barely Political because you barely wear any clothes, right? Is that...
ETTINGER: That could be partial reason, yes.
O'REILLY: Is there any other reason they would call it Barely Political?
ETTINGER: We make videos that aren't — you're not really supposed to take them too seriously.
O'REILLY: Oh, I know.
ETTINGER: Obviously.
O'REILLY: Right.
ETTINGER: So we want to make people laugh. And like you said yourself, satire is good for the country.
O'REILLY: That's true.
ETTINGER: So that's what we're doing.
O'REILLY: You're like Jon Stewart. Much better looking.
ETTINGER: Thanks.
O'REILLY: That's what you are.
(NEW VIDEO CLIP)
MR. T, ACTOR: Everybody know it's not serious. I never hurt nobody, Bill. I've been — I am a tough guy. I trained to be tough. I conditioned my body to be tough. I'm not a predator. I've been in this business over 30 years.
O'REILLY: Right.
MR. T: You haven't heard about me beating nobody up or nothing like that. I don't get in trouble.
O'REILLY: I don't think anybody thinks that you had anything to do with the Snickers thing other than driving the thing and shooting the machine gun at the guy and eating the Snickers bar. But why do you think that Mars, the parent company, pulled it?
MR. T: I don't know. Maybe they worry about the pressure or something like that, you know. So, you know, it's a controversy, you know.
O'REILLY: Yes, sure. If you were gay, would you be offended by this commercial?
MR. T: No. As a matter of fact, because one — there was some guys. They did — on the Internet, the YouTube, they was saying, "Wait a minute." One guy from London or England said, "I'm gay, and I thought it was funny."
(NEW VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Now, do you respect the guys who want to fight the Iraq war, the people who have been there and resign up and want...
PHIL DONAHUE, FORMER TALK SHOW HOST: Of course I do.
O'REILLY: Do you respect people like me who support their decision?
DONAHUE: I don't respect a continued endorsement of a war that was called with absolutely no evidence to support a reason for unprovoked invasion of Iraq.
O'REILLY: Now, you didn't want the invasion of Afghanistan by armed forces. You wanted an international police action. In Vietnam you were against that war, too. But did you ever think that, when the United States pulled out of Vietnam, at least two million people were slaughtered by the Khmer Rouge and the North Vietnamese? Did you ever think about those two million people who were murdered and their skulls piled on top of one another that they would be alive if the United States had stayed in Vietnam.
DONAHUE: Of course I do. These are irreplaceable children of God…
O'REILLY: OK, but they died.
DONAHUE: …human beings and I feel very badly about it, and I'd like to stop this kind of mayhem. And one of the things all of us have to do in order to reach that end is to stop calling each other names.

O'REILLY: Going forward, we're going to be swell. Look, from August '07 to August of '08 — don't — look, stop the BS here. Stop the crap. From August of '07 to August of '08.
REP. BARNEY FRANK, D-N.Y.: Here is the problem going on your show.
O'REILLY: This industry declined 90 percent. Ninety percent. Oh, none of this was your fault. Oh, no. People lost millions of dollars. It wasn't your fault. Come on, you coward.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: I should have sent Barney a Christmas card, you know? I should have done that, just a little olive branch.
Tuesday night, we'll have part two of the best interviews of the year, starring Hillary Clinton and Ted Turner, among others.
