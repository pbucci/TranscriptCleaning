Even though there is hateful rhetoric on the right, you do not hear many conservative Americans throwing around terms like racist, sexist, homophobic.
But, on the left those smears have now become a cottage industry. Interstate Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki and Marie Harf, who are disenchanted with me, your humble correspondent. It all began with my criticism of Jen Psaki who often does not answer questions preferring to dodge and weave.

JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON, D.C. CORRESPONDENT: Does the Obama administration consider this an act of war?
JENNIFER "JEN" PSAKI, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: We certainly -- I am not going to put new labels on it, James.

JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: But are American munitions that were given by the U.S. to Egypt, are they actually tools of slaughter, do we know that, one way or the other?
PSAKI: Well, Jake, obviously, we are watching every events that is happening on the ground very closely.
TAPPER: I do not want to waste your time or our viewers, but I will respectfully note you are not answering that question.

O'REILLY: Now, because you and I are paying Ms. Psaki's salary and because her job is to answer questions about foreign affairs, I personally get insulted when she or other government officials avoid answering legitimate questions. And, so earlier this week in a discussion with FNC correspondent James Rosen this happened.

ROSEN: When I asked Jen Psaki today in today's briefing about the apparent contradiction between wanting to destroy something and then wanting simply to reduce it to a manageable problem, she accused me of trying to, quote, "Twist words and play word games, Bill."
O'REILLY: OK, but with all due respect and you do not have to comment on that, that woman looks way out of her depth over there, just the way she delivers. It just does not look like she has the gravitas for that job.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: OK. So, that is my opinion. And, as always I could be wrong. But, I am not wrong about this. The state department's response was ridiculous.

HARF: I think that when the anchor of a leading cable news show uses, quite frankly, sexist, personally offensive language, that I actually do not think they would ever use about a man against a person that shares this podium with me, I think I have an obligation and I think it is important to step up and say that is not OK.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: So, Ms. Harf is telling the world that I would never ever, ever say something like that about a man. Well, tell that to White House Spokesman Josh Ernest?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Josh Ernest, OK. He looks to me to be befuddled. I mean, Jay Carney, you may not have liked him but he looked like he understood the process. Mr. Ernest does not look like he has a lot of credibility. Is that the buzz in the press corps? I know you have got to work with him and I do not expect to you hammer him but he looks uncertain to me.

O'REILLY: Now, we asked Jen Psaki and Marie Harf to come on "The Factor" tonight, but they are afraid. I hope that is not a sexist comment because many men are afraid to come on this program. But, the main point here is that smearing people is unacceptable, especially by folks representing the U.S. Government.
I mean, Ms. Harf did not just go out there and say that off the top of her head. Secretary State Kerry had to sign off on it and it was a foolish thing to do. He should know better. But, this is what we are seeing right now in America, cheap shot alley coming from powerful politicians. Listen to the head of the democratic national committee.

DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIR: Scott Walker has given women the back of his hands. And there is no -- I know that is stock. I know that is direct, but that is reality. What Republican Tea Party extremists like Scott Walker are doing is they are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back and it is unacceptable. And, it is not going to happen on our watch.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: All right. Now Congressman Woman Wasserman Schultz attacking Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker because she does not like his point of view on abortion and other issues. Ms. Wasserman Schultz has now apologized kind of, but she has done stuff like that in the past. All Americans should demand that public servants deal with the issues and not embrace the tactics of gutter snipes.
Really, is that too much to ask? And, that is "The Memo".
