BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST: In the at "Your Beck and Call" segment tonight, Glenn Beck's last day on Fox News will be June 30th, a day of mourning.
And here he is, "The Beckmeister."
GLENN BECK, FOX NEWS HOST: "Day of mourning"?
O'REILLY: For everybody.
BECK: Like "morning has broken."
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: I got to give you credit, Beck. You're going on a circuit safari. Surfing the Malibu pipeline.
BECK: Yes. You will soon find out.
O'REILLY: June 30th.
BECK: June 30th. Do I still get to come back and visit you?
O'REILLY: Yes. Yes. I mean, if you want to.
BECK: Well --
O'REILLY: You are kind of big now. Is that the Harvard tie you have got going there?
BECK: No.
O'REILLY: It looks like the Harvard logo.
BECK: No. I wouldn't be caught dead in a Harvard tie.
(CROSSTALK)
BECK: No, thank you.
O'REILLY: All right. So, you got to watch Beck because he's only got a few more weeks here and then he'll be doing whatever he wants to do.
BECK: What are you going to do without me, Bill? Seriously. This show was nothing before I arrived.
O'REILLY: Not going to be the same.
BECK: I know.
O'REILLY: All right. Let's get to the news of the day. Sarah Palin on the little bus tour. She goes up to --
BECK: I don't know if I would classify it as a little bus tour.
O'REILLY: It's a big bus tour. OK.
BECK: This is getting a lot of attention.
O'REILLY: Right. My mistake. It's not little, it's big.
BECK: Yes.
O'REILLY: All right. She rolls into the "Live Free or Die" state, New Hampshire, which we both like, on the day that Mitt Romney announces for president in New Hampshire.
BECK: You are saying that's not helpful?
O'REILLY: I don't know. What do you think?
BECK: I don't know. I mean, I am not a war gamer on these kinds of things. I would imagine if I'm Mitt Romney, I'm thinking that's not exactly helpful. But did she have -- I know the press.
O'REILLY: Clam bake. It was a clam bake.
BECK: I know the press is all upset. I actually saw a story that said Sarah Palin is making things dangerous for the press because she won't give us her itinerary. Stop following her.
O'REILLY: Good for her.
BECK: Hello. That was really dangerous for the press with Princess Diana in the tunnel, too. Wasn't it? But did Mitt Romney have that or did she have Mitt Romney's schedule.
O'REILLY: Romney is not going to say -- I'm sure she knew that Romney was -- everybody knew. Even you, that he was going to give his speech today and then she showed up, OK, look, I don't care. These guys can do whatever they want to.
BECK: Do you think she is running?
O'REILLY: No.
BECK: I don't think so either.
O'REILLY: Beck and I and Morris, everybody is together we don't think she is. But, you know, we are all pinheads, so she may embarrass us this next week.
BECK: The one thing I'm wrong about all time is politics.
O'REILLY: All right. So, Romney announces today. He is obviously setting himself as America's CEO. He's setting himself up that way. Effective?
BECK: I think health care is really ...
O'REILLY: So, you still think that?
BECK: I do.
O'REILLY: So, does that eliminate him or just make it hard?
BECK: I think it does for a lot of people that I know, it does eliminate Romney because he's never really come to terms with -- I know it's a states rights thing. It's never really.
O'REILLY: Well, I got an advance the copy of his speech about health care thing. He says he really didn't want to pass it; he was "hacked into."
BECK: "Hacked"? Really?
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Took you a little while to get that because I got to segue into the Weiner thing. It was hacked.
BECK: Yes, it was hacked.
O'REILLY: Can't say with "certitude" if the health care --
(CROSSTALK)
BECK: Bill O'Reilly, may I ask you, and I'm sorry to do this to you, America.
O'REILLY: No bad puns.
BECK: No bad puns. I'm sorry to do this to you. How hard of a question is that to answer?
O'REILLY: The point is that this is -- I don't care about that.
BECK: No. You hit it last night's "Talking Points." You hit it out of the park.
O'REILLY: It's the hacking.
BECK: Absolutely.
O'REILLY: And the Chinese are over there you are a big --
BECK: This isn't a hacking. This is not a hacking.
O'REILLY: You do not believe in the congressman?
BECK: You know what? Gave him the benefit of the doubt until yesterday. You know, when he gave the press conference. Did he give more today where he's like -- without certitude. With certitude, say that there's -- no, I can't say. Come on.
O'REILLY: You're not believing anything here.
BECK: No. You know what? I don't have it out for the congressman.
O'REILLY: I think the Fox News Channel has been very restrained particularly because Weiner came in here and worked over Megyn Kelly, remember that? Oh, yes. Yelling and we wouldn't stop.
BECK: He had -- last year he had congressional hearings. He was a hatchet man for the left. He had congressional hearings about one of my radio sponsors to try to discredit them to be able to somehow or another put me out.
O'REILLY: After your gold bond thing. That's what he was after.
BECK: The number one rated gold company out there.
O'REILLY: Right. Then you found out the U.S. Chamber of Commerce a good rating. But you are absolutely right. You had every reason in the world.
BECK: I haven't even -- I haven't even talked about it on television.
O'REILLY: I know. We haven't had one bad pun here on the program. Pun-free zone. Megyn Kelly is desperately trying to get back in the building. We won't let her. She is on maternity leave.
BECK: She's like, "Please!"
(CROSSTALK)
BECK: She might even just -- you, you kept me out of the studio.
O'REILLY: The guys that are working the congressman over the worst are Stewart and Colbert.
BECK: Yes, I think it's Colbert [Pronounced, "Col-BEAR"].
O'REILLY: No, it isn't. It's Colbert. I was down in South Carolina and people were coming up and were like, it's Colbert. That's what we know him for. Colbert. They are working him over.
BECK: Right. They should.
O'REILLY: Why?
BECK: It's the most ridiculous thing ever. And, look, the FBI should investigate.
O'REILLY: Absolutely.
BECK: Because, if it was hacking, we should know. Not us, the government should know.
O'REILLY: That's right.
BECK: And that guy should go to jail, period.
O'REILLY: See, Beck is so brilliant at times, mostly when he agrees with me. Glenn Beck, everybody, there he is. Catch him while we have him.
