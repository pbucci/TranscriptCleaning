E.D. HILL, GUEST HOST: Time for the "Factor TV Icon" of the week. It's a classic. Several years ago, Bill interviewed the actress whose portrayal of a perfect mom in "Leave It to Beaver" made June Cleaver an iconic character in American culture.

BILL O'REILLY, HOST: When you guys are shooting that show, did you know it was going to become this American icon classic?
BARBARA BILLINGSLEY, ACTRESS, JUNE CLEAVER, "LEAVE IT TO BEAVER": No way.
O'REILLY: There were three programs in the '50s that really dominated: "Father Knows Best," "Ozzie and Harriet" and "Leave It to Beaver." And what they all had was this Americana, this, you know, Norman Rockwell feel about it. Did you realize that was going on?
BILLINGSLEY: I just wish that we could have more families like those. Family is so important, and I just don't think we have enough people staying home with their babies and their children.
O'REILLY: Do you think that's why the show that you did is so endearing to people even now, because that's the way people would like it to be?
BILLINGSLEY: I think so.
O'REILLY: When you were watching this show and you were a little kid, you're like, "Yes, I wish my mom" â€” you were the best dressed mom on the face of earth by the way, Ms. Billingsley. You were always gloriously turned out.
BILLINGSLEY: Some of those clothes came from Penny's. They weren't expensive clothes.
O'REILLY: The best character on the program, for me, was Eddie Haskell, because he was a wise guy. Do you keep in touch with all these people?
BILLINGSLEY: Oh yes, oh yes.
O'REILLY: And I understand you even stay in touch with Lumpy.
BILLINGSLEY: Yes, Lumpy is my broker.
O'REILLY: He's your stockbroker. What about Jerry Mathers? Do you see him at all?
BILLINGSLEY: I don't see him as much. He's a dear person.
O'REILLY: We have to run, Ms. Billingsley. We thank you very, very much.
BILLINGSLEY: Sorry. Thank you. I loved being here.
