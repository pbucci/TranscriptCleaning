BILL O'REILLY, HOST: "Personal story segment" tonight, every year Barbara Walters does a special for ABC called the ten most fascinating people. And this year, the program runs tomorrow, Thursday evening, at 10:00 p.m. And Imus made the list.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARBARA WALTERS: Will you be a more cautious...
IMUS: Well, in my view, for example, Vice President Cheney is still a war criminal, and Hillary Clinton is still Satan. So...
WALTERS: OK. That hasn't changed here.
IMUS: And I'm back on the radio, but they're not innocent people. They're not kids playing for the, you know, playing for the NCAA women's national basketball championship who didn't deserve to be made fun of.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: All right. With us now is the aforementioned Barbara Walters.
Now, do you pick these people?
BARBARA WALTERS, ABC NEWS: Yes.
O'REILLY: You do, alone? You sit around with your pinhead producers, and you all...
WALTERS: My big pinheaded -- Bill Getty's pretty tall. Bill Getty, 6'4", 6'5". He's a big pinheaded...
O'REILLY: Getty. Right, yes. He's a big guy. But it's just you and Getty? You sit around?
WALTERS: We have a little staff. I mean, I could tell you that we do focus groups and people all over the country, but I would be lying. It's a small group of us. Very wise people.
O'REILLY: Do you vote on it?
WALTERS: No, we argue about it.
O'REILLY: OK, but you have the final say?
WALTERS: Yes.
O'REILLY: OK. Because I'm not going to tell everybody who's on the list, but there's some really dubious people on this list.
Now first of all, Imus is fascinating. Do you think so?
WALTERS: Well, my goodness, has there been anybody who's been more written about and talked about this past year, and now he's come back a very -- a different person? I mean...
O'REILLY: You think he's different?
WALTERS: Well, I think he's different. I think he's learned a big lesson. By the way, when he talks about Hillary Clinton and, and...
O'REILLY: Cheney.
WALTERS: Cheney, at least he's got one from either party. He's hardly prejudiced, right?
O'REILLY: Yes, he's politically correct.
All right. So are you -- but are you personally fascinated by a shock jock like Imus?
WALTERS: I think that what happened to him this year is a fascinating, controversial, interesting story.
O'REILLY: OK. I'm not going to argue with that, because it is.
WALTERS: Don't you? Don't you?
O'REILLY: Yes, I do.
WALTERS: OK.
O'REILLY: This one you can't defend. You ready?
WALTERS: Ok who? Yes.
O'REILLY: Victoria Beckham. I mean, please. Please! Who cares about that? Look at this woman. She's anorexic. She's got -- I'm not even going to say. Why? Why? Why? She's not even American.
WALTERS: Because -- well, she loves America you would be happy to know. Loves America, would like to live here. You'd Love her. She's just as crazy about America.
O'REILLY: I'd deport her.
WALTERS: The two of them, and we'll use them as two.
O'REILLY: OK. I can see why he's fascinating...he's a good actor.
WALTERS: Well, yes. But she's Posh Spice, and the Spice Girls are together again. And as a couple -- as a couple, they're an interesting couple.
O'REILLY: That's a reach. Boy, I'll tell you. Victoria Beckham.
WALTERS: No it's not. The paparazzi were all over the place...
O'REILLY: So what? All right. I'm sorry, I'm dissenting on that.
WALTERS: What have you assented with so far? Imus, you agree.
O'REILLY: I'm dissenting on that. All right.
WALTERS: OK. And we all agree that Bill Getty is a pinhead.
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Yes, there's no question about it. All right. So Victoria Beckham, I'm not buying that.
WALTERS: OK. But you like him, I've got 50 percent.
O'REILLY: Justin Timberlake.
WALTERS: Justin Timberlake.
O'REILLY: All right. Now he is an interesting guy...
WALTERS: Huge star
O'REILLY: ...He's an interesting guy. But -- but you don't know anything about him. You don't listen to his little music or...
WALTERS: I know a lot about him, because I interviewed him six years ago when he was 20 years old. We went back to his hometown. He has a very strong mother, who raised him to be a very nice guy. You don't hear slanderous things about him. He's now got a huge album out. He's -- he's doing movies. He's...
O'REILLY: He's big, he's big.
WALTERS: And by the way, we wanted diversification. We want someone from...
O'REILLY: You want the low demos. You want the 25 to 54's. You know how it goes. But let me ask you about why he's...
WALTERS: Justin Timberlake is 26 years old. I want the young Demos, too.
O'REILLY: Yes, that's what I just said. You want the young Demos.
WALTERS: Yeah, well I've got older ones.
O'REILLY: Look...
WALTERS: OK.
O'REILLY: Why is this guy fascinating? Yes, he's successful.
WALTERS: Yes.
O'REILLY: He's an idol.
WALTERS: He's hot. He's big. He's important in his field.
O'REILLY: There's a lot of people are successful.
WALTERS: Yes, but I could have done the 172 most fascinating people, and you might have made the list.
O'REILLY: No, I wouldn't have. I'm boring, and you don't want to do anything with me.
But why is he -- why is Justin Timberlake? What is it about him...
WALTERS: Because what there is about him is that he's the only person who left a boy's band and made it. He is a big star now in music and in film.
O'REILLY: What about Ricky What's-His-Name? Ricky...what's his name? Menudo? Ricky who?
WALTERS: We had him a few years ago. We did him already.
O'REILLY: Oh. He's not fascinating anymore, Ricky Martin?
WALTERS: Well, he had his time. Now, I would like to discuss the fact that you are many things, but boring, you are not.
O'REILLY: You're diverting. All right. I think Justin Timberlake is pretty fascinating. A guy like that, working class guy, makes it.
Now...
WALTERS: OK.
O'REILLY: "The View."
WALTERS: "The View," OK.
O'REILLY: I was on "The View," you know, I wouldn't go on with the Wicked Witch of the East, and you got rid of her. But with Goldberg, and I like her, Whoopi Goldberg, you're up in the ratings a little bit.
WALTERS: Isn't that interesting?
O'REILLY: Yes, and the press doesn't say that.
WALTERS: Now people, people said, you know, if we didn't have controversy and feuds. Look, when the woman you referred to as the Wicked Witch of the East...
O'REILLY: Yes. Who is that, by the way?
WALTERS: Rosie O'Donnell...
O'REILLY: Oh, I see.
WALTERS: ... did bring a lot to the show.
O'REILLY: She did.
WALTERS: I will not put her down. OK?
O'REILLY: No, you're too classy for that.
WALTERS: However, there is an edge about Whoopi and a charm about Whoopi, and Whoopi's learned a lot. She's a very mellow lady. And the audiences Love her. And then we have Sherri Shepherd, who's -- who is very conservative. Gives us another voice on...
O'REILLY: Yes, we're going to get into her not thinking that Jesus came before the Greeks.
WALTERS: Well, let me tell you what she says.
O'REILLY: No, I don't care. You don't have to do that. I like Sherri, and everybody makes mistakes.
WALTERS: I thought I'd tell you anyway.
O'REILLY: But I'm glad -- I'm glad that the show has calmed down. I must tell everybody, when I was on the show, I know a lot of the folks over there who work with you. They're much happier, and -- because Ms. Goldberg treats everybody very nicely.
WALTERS: Yes, she does.
O'REILLY: You might not agree with her politics, but she's a nice woman.
WALTERS: Yes, she is.
O'REILLY: And so are you for coming in here. We appreciate it. Sorry I gave you jazz about Victoria Beckham.
WALTERS: You know what? I'm so happy to argue with you and have fun with you. Happy holidays to you.
O'REILLY: Happy Hanukkah, Ms. Walters. Nice to see you.
