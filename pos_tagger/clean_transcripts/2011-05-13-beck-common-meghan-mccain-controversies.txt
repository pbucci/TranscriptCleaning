BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "At Your Beck and Call" segment tonight: As always, the G-man at the center of controversy. This week it's a rapper appearing at the White House and Meghan McCain appearing in a skin cancer ad. I caught up with Beck last night.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: OK, here's Beck, and he's had a very controversial week. You know, I thought that, you know, with you kind of winding down, things would...
GLENN BECK, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm not going to -- I'm not going to the old fogeys' -- I'm not going to your house.

O'REILLY: No, you're not going quietly into the night. Now even more people hating you. So let's take it one by one. This Common thing at the White House, the poetry reading. Beck and I both agree you don't honor a man like this at the White House because of what he said about two convicted cop killers, that he's sympathetic. You just don't do that. That is not the proper thing to do. So here's Beck on the radio talking about it. Go.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BECK: Now, imagine, Eric, if I got on the air everyday and said I didn't mean it but we should kill a cop. I don't mean it. You know, it's just entertainment.
This is the president of the United States holding a standard and saying, "What? What? Cop killers, they're cool."

(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Now, I don't think that's what the president of the United States is saying, "Cop killers, they're cool." I'm going to submit to you this, and I'm going to back it up. And I know some of you are going to get mad at me for saying this, but I really believe it. I don't think Barack Obama knows who the hell Common is. I don't think he's ever heard anything he's ever done. And he's got a staff that puts this stuff together and continually makes -- now, let me back up my point. When the bin Laden raid happened...

BECK: Yes.

O'REILLY: ...you would think any White House would have one spokesperson on it, one and one only. And that should have been Daley, the chief of staff. That Daley would have controlled the information coming out about the raid because it was highly sensitive; it was fluid; there were a lot of things happening. That didn't happen. Eighteen guys ran out saying all kinds of stuff about the raid that turned out not to be true. Is that correct?
BECK: Yes.
O'REILLY: Does that indicate to you there's anybody in charge there about information flow? Does it?

BECK: No.
O'REILLY: Thank you. It's the same thing here. There's no one in charge of this stuff. It's chaos.
BECK: But here's the thing.

O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: Here's the thing. I will agree with you on that.
O'REILLY: Thank you.

BECK: But these -- this is the circle this man runs around with. Bill Ayers.
O'REILLY: There is circumstantial evidence, yes.

BECK: Bill Ayers. Jeremiah Wright. Common went to Jeremiah Wright's church.
O'REILLY: He did.
BECK: OK. It's the same circle over and over and over again. The police acted -- "I have no information, but the police acted stupidly." He is clearly, his actions clearly show that he believes that the police are the oppressors.
O'REILLY: You may be right, and I may be wrong about this, but I don't think you can make the leap that the president likes a cop killer glorifier.
BECK: But if you find out, wouldn't you say the right thing to do is to not have that guy at the White House. And let me go -- let me go one more step.
O'REILLY: Go ahead.
BECK: Also at the poetry reading was somebody who said, "I found out that" -- this man, whoever it was is black, -- "is married to a white woman." And what was it she said? She said, "My soul flinched a bit when I found out." Can you imagine, Bill O'Reilly, saying, "When I found out my white friend was married to a black woman, my soul flinched a bit"?
O'REILLY: Well, and then look. The president is half white. So there are all kinds of implications to saying stupid stuff. But I will submit once again I don't think there's anybody in charge at that White House. No one.
Now, you also got -- you also got Cindy McCain, John McCain's wife, mad at you.
BECK: Really? Oh, boy.
O'REILLY: Because her daughter, Meghan, appeared in this anti-skin cancer ad undraped, and here's what Beck said about that:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm watching this Meghan McCain video where she's naked.
BECK: (SOUND EFFECT: THROWING UP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It happened multiple times.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you still looking at the Meghan McCainâ€¦
BECK: (SOUND EFFECT: THROWING UP)

(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Now if I were Cindy McCain, I'd slap the hell out of you.

BECK: Cindy McCain, you were right for what you said. You're sticking up for your daughter. I would do the same thing.

O'REILLY: I -- and I'll let her in if she flies in from Arizona. I will let her beat the hell out of you right here on this program so everybody can watch.
BECK: Let me ask you something. Put this in perspective.

O'REILLY: OK.
BECK: First of all, that bit doesn't work on television. Only works on the radio. Sounds.
O'REILLY: Didn't work on radio either, Beck. OK.

BECK: We've got somebody singing about killing cops, and everybody runs to his defense.

O'REILLY: Not me.

BECK: Not you. Everybody, all the left, they run to his defense.
O'REILLY: Right.

BECK: I make vomit sounds when someone is disrobed.

O'REILLY: For a good cause.

BECK: What? What was the cause?

O'REILLY: Skin cancer.
BECK: What was she saying? What was she saying?
O'REILLY: Use sun block.
BECK: Yes. She's saying cover up. Cover up. Cover up. All I'm doing is helping bring attention to this.

O'REILLY: Oh, that's why did you it.

BECK: I'm saying cover up. Cover up. I'm with you. That's why I'm not naked now.

O'REILLY: OK. I'm giving you a hard time. But what people don't know about you, particularly the people that don't like you, is that you are genuinely a nice guy. You're a much nicer guy than I am. You really are.
BECK: Don't blow this for me. I worked hard on this.

O'REILLY: I've been on the road with Beck. I mean, you are nice to everybody who comes up to you, all right? You go out of your way to make people feel good. And then you do these dopey things on the radio, and they all think you're a bad guy.

BECK: He's lying.

O'REILLY: No.

BECK: He's lying. I'm a bad, bad man.
O'REILLY: I'm scolding you. You shouldn't have done that to Meghan.

BECK: Can I tell you something? I said this morning, not on the radio because I wasn't going to admit this, you know, it's a juvenile, a juvenile bit. Absolutely juvenile bit. But you know what? Meghan McCain, please.

O'REILLY: She's OK.

BECK: Looks, I don't care what she looks like.
O'REILLY: Meghan McCain.
BECK: No. I have had enough of Meghan McCain, as much as she has had of me. She has a right to say what she says about me.

O'REILLY: All right. She's an honest young woman giving her opinion, give her a break. Glenn Beck, everybody.
