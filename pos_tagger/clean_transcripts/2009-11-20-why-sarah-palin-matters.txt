I'm going to keep this short because we have a substantial interview with the governor this evening.
It took us more than a year to get Sarah Palin on "The Factor." The McCain people kept her away from us. So when she writes about the senator's campaign muzzling her in her new book, I know that's true.
There is no question Sarah Palin is a media star who commands attention wherever she goes. In America today, that's enough for her to build on if she wants to run for president in 2012.
Very simply, that's why Sarah Palin matters. She's big. She could mount a serious primary challenge. That's why the far left despises her. Mrs. Palin has the attention of the folks.
And that's "The Memo."
Pinheads & Patriots
Former "American Idol" winner Jordin Sparks is doing a good thing. She's on a media tour urging teenagers not to text and drive, which is a huge problem in America. For this, Ms. Sparks is a patriot.
On the pinhead front, Forbes magazine analyzed some Hollywood stars to see whether they're worth their salaries.
Actor Will Ferrell came in dead last. Apparently for every dollar they pay him, the studio takes in only $3.29. By contrast, Shia LaBeouf, who starred in the "Transformers" movies, brings in $160 for every dollar he's paid.
You can look at this two ways: Either Mr. Ferrell is a pinhead, or he's incredibly smart for earning all that money for so little return. You make the call.
