BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "At Your Beck and Call" segment tonight: an interesting situation involving the rapper Jay-Z. As you may know, last January, on inauguration weekend, he said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAY-Z, RAPPER: Never thought I'd say this (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Baby, I'm good. You can keep your (UNINTELLIGIBLE). I don't want no more Bush. No more war, no more Iraq, no more white lies. My president is black.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: However, tonight, Jay-Z is holding a benefit at Madison Square Garden here in New York City to help the families of police officers and firefighters killed on 9/11. So what are we going to make of this guy?
Here now, the always provocative and sometimes very sensitive Glenn Beck. Jay-Z, now, are you buddies with him?
GLENN BECK, HOST, "GLENN BECK": Love him.
O'REILLY: You love him?
BECK: Oh, he is — you know, this might come as a surprise to a lot of listeners or viewers, but I am — I blend in the rap crowd.
O'REILLY: I've heard you hang with Snoop Dogg.

BECK: It's crazy. I don't want to drop names or anything like that. But actually, Bill, I have — you know, he mentioned you on his last...
O'REILLY: Did he, in one of his songs?
BECK: You know that, right? This is when he said this ain't black vs. white, my — anyway, he went off to — and said a lot of things. Please tell Bill O'Reilly to fall back.
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: It's not 2010 or 1864. I don't know if you're aware of that.
O'REILLY: I don't know what it means.
BECK: But are you aware of that?
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: Good friend of mine that works here at New York, Lisa Paige for 92.3 FM.
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: Here, your book. Could you show — there's Lisa. There's Jay-Z.
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: Lisa went, and she — can you show him signing the book? Do you have the other picture? There he is.
O'REILLY: He's signing "Bold Fresh."
BECK: He's signing the book. Here it is.
O'REILLY: Does he have any clue?
BECK: Yes. Oh, yes.
O'REILLY: He knew it was me?
BECK: Oh, yes. Right here. "Peace, Bill. Jay-Z. Off that."
O'REILLY: "Off that." What does that "off that" mean?
BECK: I don't know. I believe it's pronounced, "Off THAT."
O'REILLY: But you're a rapper guy.
BECK: Look, I don't know. Look...
O'REILLY: You don't know what it means.
BECK: You won't understand.
O'REILLY: Of course.
BECK: I mean, you're not — a lot of people — they look at you and say he might be a guy in rap.
O'REILLY: I don't know what they're talking about. I freely admit I have no idea what they're saying. But what are we — what are we supposed to think of this guy who does this little racial rap at the inauguration weekend and then holds a benefit? What do you think? Is he a good guy or what?
BECK: I'm going to come clean with you, Bill. I have no idea who the hell this guy even is.
O'REILLY: I think he's a good businessman.
BECK: Look, I mean, I'm — I'm tired of the race thing. I don't think the race thing works anymore. You know what I mean? There are racists.
O'REILLY: It works in the hip-hop community.
BECK: Yes, whatever. But there are racists. There is real racism. Every time you throw it out meaninglessly...
O'REILLY: Right. It denigrates the real problem.
BECK: Yes, yes.
O'REILLY: Now, ACORN, another scandal, it's like one a day now. This is Washington. Yesterday it was Baltimore. They had to fire two people there. Now we have a guy and a lady going in undercover.
BECK: They fired two people in Baltimore?
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: They said yesterday this was defamatory and fraudulent.
O'REILLY: They had to fire them, because they knew you and I were on the case. Now, these guys, the undercover guys, went to Washington to — posing as pimps and prostitutes. Roll the tape.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can have a business. She's not going to put on (UNINTELLIGIBLE) that she's doing prostitution.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She's not going to put on that. But that's the reason for — that's the reason for us getting her the house.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She can be a sole proprietor, and she's making money, not saying that it's those kind of services that she's — whether she wants to sell gold, whether she's on the telephone, whether she's in marketing, whether she provides services as a marketer. Do you understand what I'm saying?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: So they're basically telling them, "You can buy a brothel. Here's how you do it."
BECK: What's wrong with that? These people are compassionate. They're just trying to help out.
O'REILLY: The ACORN people have gotten $56 million taxpayer dollars. I'm saying no more money. Not another taxpayer dime goes to this.
BECK: You know what? Look, America, I'm going to announce — tomorrow I'm going to be on the television from 1 until 3 here, covering the March on Washington and the tea parties and the 9/12 project all over the country. And I'm going to announce the next — the next phase. And that is, has the heart of our problems and the thing that we can unite on is corruption.
O'REILLY: Right.
BECK: This whole system is corrupt.
O'REILLY: Right. Whole ACORN thing top to bottom, right.
BECK: It's beyond ACORN. You can't talk about fixing health care until you clean up the corruption.
O'REILLY: But ACORN itself is a corrupt organization.
BECK: Yes, but you know what?
O'REILLY: You and I are investigating the Louisiana connection, the state attorney general down there.
BECK: The Louisiana connection, which also in the same building is ACORN and SEIU.
O'REILLY: Right.
BECK: Who does the president surround himself with? ACORN and SEIU. Well, gee, there's corruption there. We can't take anything.
O'REILLY: No more — no more taxpayer money, and if we find out about it…
BECK: Nothing.
O'REILLY: Right. No more bidding. No more anything. If we find out about it, we're going to expose all the politicians that are involved.
BECK: Did you see the ratings last night on this whole network?
O'REILLY: Yes, very high. Very high. You did very well.
BECK: But here's the reason why I bring it up. Did you see the ratings on the other networks? We were the only ones that were covering this story. The New York Times didn't cover it.
O'REILLY: No, of course not.
BECK: Nobody covered it. Nobody covered it.
O'REILLY: All right, today is the anniversary of 9/11. You got a little emotional on your program. I was watching you. A little emotional. Nothing wrong with that. You and Jack Parr. Remember Jack? Way back?
BECK: Yes. I'm not that old.
O'REILLY: No. But you were — you were angry and rightfully so that they haven't been able to put the buildings back, right?
BECK: Yes.
O'REILLY: Whose fault is that?
BECK: The system's fault. The politicians, the corruption, the special interests. Do you know — do you know there's no investigation? There's nobody calling for an investigation in ACORN. There's nobody calling for an investigation why this country hasn't built a building in eight years on that space. How is that possible in America?
O'REILLY: They're working on it.
BECK: No investigations on any of these things, Bill. But do you know that they just appointed a 12-person panel to look into the Cambridge police officer? A 12-person panel.
O'REILLY: This is about the Gates thing, right?
BECK: Yes. That's amazing.
O'REILLY: An interesting fact on your program today: that it took 400 days to build the Empire State Building.
BECK: Yes.
O'REILLY: And that includes putting King Kong on top of it.
BECK: I don't know about that. King Kong goes up.
O'REILLY: That was hard. Very, very hard.
BECK: Very long time.
O'REILLY: Four hundred days, ladies and gentlemen, to build the Empire State Building. And it's eight years, and they still don't have anything close.
BECK: Nothing. So Bill, let me ask you this. Are we different Americans? Are we different?
O'REILLY: It's the power structure.
BECK: It's exactly right, and it's corrupt. And it is — it is in bed with special interests. Because I guarantee you, if you take all that system out, if you take those politicians, the special interests, and all of the — all of the little politically correct groups out of the way, we would have built it with our hands within a year.
O'REILLY: All right. Beck is down there with a hammer on Sunday, so go see him. Glenn Beck, everybody.
