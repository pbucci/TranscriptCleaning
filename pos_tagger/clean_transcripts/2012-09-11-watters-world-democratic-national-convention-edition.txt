DAN RATHER, FORMER CBS ANCHOR: Fine. Glad to see you. Thank you very much.

WATTERS: Well, you know.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JASON ALEXANDER, ACTOR: Oh, well. That's very mature.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Is Hollywood excited about President Obama's re-election as they were in 2008.
PATRICIA ARQUETTE, ACTRESS: The question of if you're doing better than four years ago, you have to look at what's happened in the last four years.
BEN JEALOUS, PRESIDENT, NAACP: Well, back where they were 100 years ago, with Civil Rights, only had a serious place in one party. It should have a place in both parties.
TERRY MCAULIFFE, ADVISOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY: I'm a big Obama guy. And the President is going to win. It's exciting, you feel the energy.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So what.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARQUETTE: I don't think a lot of people are necessarily thinking, "Is this president or that president." The reality is, it was decades of both parties making decisions.
WATTERS: What's the democratic plan to reduce the debt.
BILL RICHARDSON, FORMER GOVERNOR, NEW MEXICO: The plan is balance, cuts, and social programs, defense, and target.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RICHARD JENKINS, ACTOR: We literally have never done any of those things.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN CANDY, ACTOR: Is there any particular reason why you're giving me such a hard time.
WATTERS: Is there a war on women right now.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of people treat women as second class citizens.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEVE MARTIN: Wait a second.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARQUETTE: I think it's important for people to think about a woman's right to choose.
WATTERS: Do you think there's conservative bias or liberal bias in the media.
RATHER: I think it cuts both ways.
WATTERS: You look like a huge O'Reilly fan.
LEGUIZAMO: Oh, I love O'Reilly. He's from New York. He's from Long Island, man.
WATTERS: Do you watch the show a lot.
LEGUIZAMO: I don't watch TV a lot.
RATHER: I couldn't say a bad word about Bill O'Reilly. He's great.
WATTERS: Staying out of trouble.
BURTON: I don't need to use the sunglasses in the rain here.
WATTERS: I know. I'm going to need an umbrella. Can I borrow yours.

O'REILLY: You know what I took away from that.
WATTERS: What'd you take away.
O'REILLY: How happy Dan Rather was to see you.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: No, he did not like look pleased at all.
O'REILLY: And Eva Longoria, was that her running away with the ponytail.
WATTERS: No, the story about that though, we were trying to stakeout Sandra Fluke. So, I said, "There she is." So, we chased her down.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: My camera guy thought that Eva Longoria's assistant was Sandra Fluke. So, all of a sudden, he elbows Eva Longoria out of the way and turns the camera on her assistant.
O'REILLY: Ooh.
WATTERS: So, that's why it looked a little hectic out there.
O'REILLY: So, your cameraman didn't know who Eva Longoria is.
WATTERS: No, no. He thought Sandra Fluke --
O'REILLY: There she goes. There she goes.
WATTERS: Right. Running away.
O'REILLY: You know, she's my top interview.
WATTERS: Really.
O'REILLY: Forget about Biden, I don't care.
WATTERS: OK.
O'REILLY: I want Eva Longoria in there.
WATTERS: I'm sorry, I couldn't bring that to you.
O'REILLY: Because I want to find -- and I like that Patricia Arquette. I thought she was good.
WATTERS: She was well-spoken.
O'REILLY: She put forth her view and was even articulate. We like that. But I'd love to know, because Miss Longoria got a lot of air time at the convention, I don't know she arrived at these conclusions.
But, anyway, overall how were you treated in Charlotte.
WATTERS: I was treated pretty well. I only had one incident, I was kicked out of the Omni Hotel.
We tried to interview Mayor Menino, you know the Boston guy who kicked out Chick-fil-A.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: So, I asked him, you know, "Do you feel bad about the fact that you've created all this controversy that this crazed gunman went up and shot up this conservative outfit."
O'REILLY: And Menino said.
WATTERS: He goes, "I don't even know what you're talking about." He had never of it. I couldn't believe it, so then I left and security descended on me.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And said, "If you step foot inside the Omni Hotel, we're charging you with second degree trespassing.
O'REILLY: Ooh. You should've. You should've.
WATTERS: I know. So, when I leave, the security guy goes, "Hey, by the way, big FACTOR fan. Keep up the good work."
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: We had the bail money for you. They treated me very nicely in Charlotte, everybody. And I just want to say the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Charlotte, much better than the Omni.
I mean, that was really a crisp hotel, very good hotel. Jesse Watters, everybody.
