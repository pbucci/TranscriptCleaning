As you may remember, the president and his team harshly criticized Fox News last fall for not being fair and that led to a vigorous back and forth between FNC and the White House, which jazzed our ratings a bit. Then things kind of died down.
But now the oil spill has muddied the waters once again. I apologize deeply for the atrocious pun.
The latest round began on Cavuto's program earlier this week. Michael Brown, President Bush's point man on Hurricane Katrina, said this about President Obama's posture on the oil spill:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MICHAEL BROWN, FORMER FEMA DIRECTOR: If the winds are right, it'll go up the East coast. This is exactly what they want because now he can pander to the environmentalists and say I'm going to shut it down because it's too dangerous. While Mexico and China and everybody else drills in the Gulf, we're going to get shut down.

Now, I don't think Mr. Obama wants the oil spill to expand. In fact, I usually dismiss conspiracy theories like that.
But Mr. Brown's opinion annoyed the administration, and the subject came up Tuesday when our White House guy Wendell Goler asked a question:

WENDELL GOLER, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: As for critics who are calling this your Katrina, is there — President Obama's Katrina…
ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Can I say this? I watched Fox yesterday.
GOLER: I really didn't want you to go there.
GIBBS: But you sort of opened both the double doors and, voila, here I am.
GOLER: It wasn't just Fox calling this your Katrina.
GIBBS: No, no, but Fox had the very special and unique interview with Michael Brown. You opened it and I had to do it, who for those who weren't let in on the big secret, Mr. Brown, FEMA Director Brown under Katrina intimated on Fox and it wasn't — I will editorially say didn't appear to be pushed back on real hard, that this spill was leaked on purpose in order for us to walk back our environmental and drilling decisions, and that the leak that we did on purpose got out of control and now is too big to contain.

So my question is: Why does the White House care what Michael Brown says?
Look, we can't control what the guests say. Cavuto actually stuck up for the president during the interview with Brown. So "Talking Points" believes this deal is phony, a canard, a charade.
The lingering issue is that Fox News is by far the toughest media outlet on President Obama, and he doesn't much like it. Understandable.
But the White House makes a mistake by bringing up dopey stuff like the Brown deal. I always tell these guys, Mr. Gibbs included, if you have a beef, bring it here. If you think you are being treated unfairly, we'll give you plenty of air time.
But give Wendell Goler and our hard news guys a break. They are fair and don't deserve scorn. I'll take that heat, gladly.
And that's "The Memo."

On the pinhead front, we know it's too easy, but the nutty president of Iran once again tops himself.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: If you did know that Usama bin Laden was in Tehran, would you show him hospitality? Would you expel him? Would you...
MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator): I heard that Usama bin Laden is in Washington, D.C.
STEPHANOPOULOS: No, you didn't.
AHMADINEJAD: Yes, I did. He's there, because he was a previous partner of Mr. Bush. They were colleagues, in fact, in the old days. You know that. They worked together. Mr. bin Laden never cooperated with Iran, but he cooperated with Mr. Bush.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Since Ahmadinejad is already in the pinhead hall of fame, this is just another reminder why.
