O'REILLY: All right now, Watters is here. We're going to continue that on Monday.
WATTERS: That's right, part two.
O'REILLY: And I understand, I'm involved --
WATTERS: You're involved.
O'REILLY: -- in the pinhead and patriot --
WATTERS: It's even funnier than this one. And Biden is involved, too, so it's great, you know.
O'REILLY: All right. Me, Biden, who else.
WATTERS: You, Biden -- I think Harry Reid is involved.
O'REILLY: Reid.
WATTERS: Boehner.
O'REILLY: Uh-huh.
WATTERS: You know, all the --
O'REILLY: All the heavyweights.
WATTERS: Yes, the big guys. The big guns.
O'REILLY: Now, when we make fun of other people, we're doing it an affectionate way.
WATTERS: Of course.
O'REILLY: I mean, you know -- because that's just a lot of characters.
WATTERS: Right.
O'REILLY: I mean, the guy with the Yankee shirt is a character.
WATTERS: Right. I think he's still drunk from the night before.
O'REILLY: He looked like he did.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
You know, he's relaxed.
WATTERS: Right, right.
O'REILLY: How many people refused, flat out refused to talk to you when you go into a form like this.
WATTERS: Well, the --
O'REILLY: That percentage.
WATTERS: -- percentage, I'd say maybe 10 percent.
O'REILLY: Do they all know THE FACTOR. Do they all know --
WATTERS: No. Sometimes, it's just the way I look, or if I'm holding cards or something like that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: OK. And if you have the collar up in the back.
WATTERS: Yes, that would just repel people automatically.
O'REILLY: And I guess that's about 30, 30 percent, you know, look.
WATTERS: That's right.
O'REILLY: But, generally speaking, what percentage of the people know THE FACTOR. When you say, THE O'REILLY FACTOR, what does it -- what percentage.
WATTERS: Know THE FACTOR, I'd say about 50 to 60 percent.
O'REILLY: Of those people?
WATTERS: Yes, yes. And, you know, we tabulated some of these answers. Pelosi, two to one called her a pinhead. And only a third knew who she was.
O'REILLY: A third.
WATTERS: Ted Cruz, only one person out of 14 people knew who Ted Cruz was.
O'REILLY: Really, only one of 14.
WATTERS: And that -- yes. And he was determined to be a pinhead, two to one, OK.
O'REILLY: Uh-hmm.
WATTERS: And then we're going to have your tabulation on Monday. So, check that out.
O'REILLY: It will be interesting to see how many people knew me.
WATTERS: Yes.
O'REILLY: All right. Jesse Watters, everybody. Once again, Monday night, we will do part two of "Pinheads and Patriots."
