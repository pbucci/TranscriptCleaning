WATTERS: Least sexy.
O'REILLY: -- college of the United States.
WATTERS: Yes.
O'REILLY: We don't want to say who it is.
WATTERS: Right.
O'REILLY: But you've already been there.
WATTERS: I've already been there. And there are some controversy involved. It's a hotly-contested ranking.
O'REILLY: But it seemed that the students at the University of Wisconsin were kind of happy with this moniker.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Yes, they're very proud of that. I mean, why wouldn't you be.
O'REILLY: Well, whoa! You know, in the Vietnam era when I was college, you would've gotten beat up if you said, "Hey!" Because you had to be socially conscious.
And we reject all of that. Don't you know, that's what was going on in the 60s and 70s.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Oh, now, OK. So, this is now like a progressive thing to be liberal and sexy, open with your sexuality.
O'REILLY: Madison was a very hotbed, radical place. And if you had gone here 40 years ago and said, "Hey," they would have thrown you right into the river.
WATTERS: Right. I think, now, they're embracing their sexuality.
O'REILLY: They are.
WATTERS: And I think everybody is happy for it.
O'REILLY: OK. Well, that the way it came across, Watters.
(LAUGHTER)
So, Watters will be back on Thursday with the --
WATTERS: The follow-up.
