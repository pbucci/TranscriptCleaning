BILL O'REILLY: While President Obama has his critics, supporters like 82-year-old singer Tony Bennett are behind him all the way.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TONY BENNETT, SINGER: I really do think every citizen of the United States would imitate the rest of the world who have all fallen for Obama. Every other country, regardless of what happened in our great country, they have expressed (UNINTELLIGIBLE) all our support in anything he wants to do.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Well not anything he wants to do, Mr. Bennett. That might mean trouble for "The Factor."
President Obama is also getting no love from Roseanne Barr.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's, you know, getting us out of Iraq. He's closing Gitmo. You can't do either of those overnight. How can you say he's the same as Bush?
ROSEANNE BARR, COMEDIAN: He's not doing that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you mean he's not doing that?
BARR: He's not going to close Gitmo.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Look at — he's trying.
BARR: Well, he's not doing it, dude.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Dude? Wasn't that a woman talking with Ms. Barr? Shouldn't it be "dudette"?
A reporter named Aaron Shrew (ph) interviewed a martial arts lady named Cyborg Casantos (ph).

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you put (UNINTELLIGIBLE) in a chokehold, how long is it going to take you to put her to sleep?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Three seconds.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It takes about three seconds? Well, to the normal person...
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One, two, three.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't, don't. Let go. Let go. Oh my God. He's out. He's out.
Good, good, good. Good. You're good. Good, good.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wait, what happened?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Where are they, Lithuania?
Even reporting on Jackson's death has its perils.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fremont Street here is the place where locals and tourists alike gather to listen to music. And people like this listen to this stuff all the time, for example. See this guy, yes, you like Michael Jackson too, don't you? Well, actually, this guy is a little out of control right now but you can't blame him for that. You know, let's tell you a little bit more about Michael Jackson.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Michael Jackson.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So basically the deal is...
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK, apparently an unruly fan out there. Involving — getting involved in — never want to do that — with Steve Ryan's live shot there.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sometimes it happens, especially when people have a little too much to drink.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Some media are making a big deal out of me saying I will not spend 10 bucks to see Sean Penn in a movie. Well, I do believe I have a responsibility to explain this a bit further, especially to younger Americans who may not understand my thinking. So, yesterday, I taped this interview.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Well, thanks for giving me a hearing. The reason Sean Penn bothers me is that he legitimizes bad people like the Castro brothers and Hugo Chavez.
SEAN PENN, ACTOR: So happening, man.
O'REILLY: Are you guys getting that?
PENN: I don't know.
O'REILLY: If I think someone is helping an evil doer, I just say no to that someone.
PENN: Oh, gnarly.
O'REILLY: Also, I think Mr. Penn doesn't like America very much. Maybe I'm wrong.
PENN: Hey, bud, what's your problem?
O'REILLY: Finally, and I appreciate you hearing me out, every American has a right to make spending choices. This is just one of mine. You can have the last word.
PENN: Oh, all I need are some tasty waves, a cool buzz, and I'm fine.
O'REILLY: Indeed.
