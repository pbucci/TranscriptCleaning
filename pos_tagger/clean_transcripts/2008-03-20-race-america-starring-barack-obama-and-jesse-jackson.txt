Senator Obama was at his most eloquent Tuesday when he said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through, a part of our union that we have not yet made perfect.

Absolutely true. Americans can only work those problems out if blacks and whites talk to each other. But that will not happen, ladies and gentlemen, until bogus claims of racism become cardinal sins. Many white Americans understand that any disagreement with a person of color could get you branded a racist. People like Jesse Jackson and far-left smear machines like Media Matters making livings off race baiting.
Here's a partial list of people branded with a racist label by Reverend Jackson: President Bush, President Bush the elder, Newt Gingrich, Gary Hart, Ronald Reagan, Trent Lott, Vicente Fox, Jeb Bush and Menachem Begin.
Here's a partial list people's race smeared by Media Matters: Alan Colmes, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Pat Buchanan, Michelle Malkin, Neil Cavuto, Neal Boortz, Michael Smerconish, Fred Barnes, Sean Hannity, Bo Dietl and John Gibson.
Talking Points is simply fed up with this and is curious to know whether Senator Obama understands that race baiters on the left are interfering with constructive dialogue. Obama mentioned conservative race people in the speech yesterday. But by far, the worst offenders are Jackson and Media Matters, both dedicated leftists.
So far, Reverend Jackson has been silent about the Reverend Wright controversy, so FOX News producer Griff Jenkins asked him about it at the far left Take Back America convention in D.C.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS PRODUCER: So Reverend, do you condemn Reverend Wright's words? I mean, six days after 9/11, he talked about our chickens are coming home to roost.
JACKSON: I'm really not going to address any of that now, frankly, because I think to cede into it is to expand it. And I'm struggling as others are to put the focus on the war, the focus on the economic alliance, the focus on poverty, which is crippling and growing, the focus on the impact of the health insurance crisis for working people.
JENKINS: But we can't deny the controversy it's caused.
JACKSON: Well, indeed it is.
JENKINS: Do you condemn Reverend Wright's comments?
JACKSON: But you do have a choice as to which you're going to speak, what your priorities are. And you'll hear my priorities today. Thank you.
JENKINS: So you won't condemn Reverend Wright's comments?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Obviously not.
Now shortly after that, Griff was confronted by a man at the convention.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're talking about...
JENKINS: Who are you with? Who are you? Who are you?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm just asking a question. I'm just asking a question. No, no, asking a question. What's a fair question? I'm a citizen. So tell me why aren't you talking to people — why aren't you talking about the Bob Jones people that want to have racial separation?
JENKINS: Why don't you let me do my job?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, no, I'm doing my job. Go ahead, answer the question, FOX News.
JENKINS: I'm going to ask you again.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Answer the question, FOX News.
Don't touch me. Answer the question, FOX News.
JENKINS: This is unnecessary.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Answer the question, FOX News.
JENKINS: That's unnecessary.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, what's the matter, FOX News, answer the question?
JENKINS: This guy is harassing me.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Answer the question, FOX News.
JENKINS: I'm not going to — I don't have to put up with this.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Answer the question, FOX News.
JENKINS: Ask a fair question.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm asking you a fair question.
JENKINS: He answered my questions. I don't need to be harassed.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Answer the question, FOX News.
JACKSON: Please don't. Please don't.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm just asking the question. I want to ask a question.
JACKSON: Please don't. Please don't. Please don't.
JENKINS: Thank you, Reverend.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Well, we appreciate Reverend Jackson being a peacemaker. And we hope he stops. We hope Jackson stops with the race branding stuff.
Bottom line is Senator Obama must understand that many white Americans will not engage in race discussions because they fear making a mistake and being called a racist. That is undeniable. And if you still don't buy it, just give liberal icon Geraldine Ferraro a call.
And that's the Memo.
Pinheads & Patriots
The New York Yankees traveled to Virginia Tuesday to play the Virginia Tech baseball team and lift some spirits. The Yanks won 11-0, but obviously, their appearance honored the college and showed respect to the people killed there last year.
In addition, Yankee owner George Steinbrenner has donated $1 million to the college memorial fund. So Mr. Steinbrenner is a patriot.
On the pinhead front, Heather Mills apparently poured water on Paul McCartney's attorney.
Judge Hugh Bennett described Ms. Mills as volatile and less than candid. In British, that means dishonest. The judge didn't call Mills a pinhead but should have.
