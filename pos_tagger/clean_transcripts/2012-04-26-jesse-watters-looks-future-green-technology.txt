BILL O'REILLY, HOST: "Watters' World" segment tonight. Last week in New York City, Green Festival was under way, an environmental exposition. And it was held at the Javits Convention Center.
Jesse Watters was very anxious to attend that, so we sent him.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JESSE WATTERS, "O'REILLY FACTOR" PRODUCER: What's your ideal green home look like?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Create your own electricity through rainwater.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You must be kidding.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think solar power is great. Solar panels always sound good.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bamboo.
WATTERS: Bamboo? The home is made of bamboo.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bamboo.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: See what I mean, boo-boo?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think wind power is great.
WATTERS: Windmills in the front lawn?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's cool.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I wonder who could have done a thing like that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In terms of lawns, too. Like, I don't really think we need to have lawns. Why don't we turn that front space into a garden?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Don't even use that eyebrow move on me. It's not going to work.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It would look a little bit like treehouse.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like a hobbit.
WATTERS: Similar to a hobbit, so the future is log cabins and what?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The future is the past.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're sending you back to the future!
WATTERS: Bill O'Reilly sends his warmest regards.
VAN JONES, FMR. GREEN JOBS CZAR: Oh, I appreciate that.
WATTERS: How do you think the president's doing so far?
JONES: I think the president is doing very well. Oil production going up, gas use going down. Both sides should be happy with this president.
WATTERS: When are we going to get you on "The Factor"? You're not dodging "The Factor," are you?
JONES: You see all these wonderful people right here? All right, thank you very much.
WATTERS: What's a green bed?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're natural latex.
WATTERS: What's the bed made out of?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Cotton, natural fibers.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I like that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What's going on here?
WATTERS: This bed costs what compared to a normal bed?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: $1,700 up to $4,500.
WATTERS: Yikes.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This particular light bulb that I have in my hand is $40.
WATTERS: Forty dollars?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Forty dollars!
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But it lasts 32 years.
WATTERS: You sell paper. And what's it made out of?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our paper products actually made from elephant dung.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think in the future, Americans will be wearing recycled clothing.
WATTERS: What if it was a black tie event? Do I have to wear, like, a recycled tux?
Are people going to be drinking this in the future?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely. We are a party in your mouth. Isn't that fun?
WATTERS: It's a party in my mouth.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would like to extend...
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... an invitation to the party.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's important that we speak to each other.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I need to know how this is really being cut, though.
WATTERS: Like I said, what we're doing is -- it's a...
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know. Listen to me. Is this a snarky piece?
WATTERS: No. No, no, no. We did this with the car show last week here.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know, but this is a very different kind of show.
WATTERS: What will power the home of the future?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Definitely solar panels.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The heat underneath, from the earth.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm kind of a fan of electricity.
WATTERS: Don't say that too loud around here!
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's an attention-getter!
WATTERS: Do you see in the future us washing our dishes by hand?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We wash all dishes by hand.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's pretty cool, I guess.
WATTERS: Do you see robots?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think there'll be robots. I think there'll just be a lot of keypad pushing.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The house is going it clean itself.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think there you need a robot.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He acts peculiar.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's kind of incorporating garden walls.
WATTERS: Do you think that's going to protect you from the elements?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not really sure what it does. You can create your own, you know, indoor garden.
WATTERS: What if I'm not vegetarian?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Then you will have some issues.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: Do you ever watch "The O'Reilly Factor"?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't really watch much TV, to be honest.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi, Bill.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: "The Factor" is on at my house quite a bit.
WATTERS: What's your favorite part of the show?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The end.
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's only the beginning.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: The end. Always a wiseguy. Now, you got booted out of there?
WATTERS: I did. I did.
O'REILLY: Why?
WATTERS: Well, I ambushed Van Jones right off the jump.
O'REILLY: That was the guy that you were talking to (INAUDIBLE)
WATTERS: That's right. I was all over their radar. So they came up to me and said, You're trying to slam the greens. It's a hatchet piece. And I told her it was an honest piece, what we were trying to do. And she was trying to protect these greens like they were her flock! They couldn't...
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: You were polite to all of them, right?
WATTERS: I brought up Solyndra and I brought up your name and then I brought up Obama. And I think that was the kicker.
O'REILLY: Now, Van Jones, he doesn't want any part of us, right?
WATTERS: No, he's afraid.
O'REILLY: He has a book out. He's got a new book out.
WATTERS: Yes. You know what he actually said? He said the EPA has saved more American lives than the Department of Defense, and that Republicans want to poison children. That was his...
O'REILLY: Jones said...
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Van Jones said that.
O'REILLY: That Republicans want to poison children?
WATTERS: Yes, he did.
O'REILLY: Was there any reason that the GOP wants to commit homicide on American...
WATTERS: Jobs. Poisoning children creates jobs.
O'REILLY: It does?
WATTERS: That's...
O'REILLY: For the poisoners or...
WATTERS: Well, you know, because the EPA...
O'REILLY: For the funeral, funeral homes?
WATTERS: The EPA is a job killer!
O'REILLY: No, wait a minute.
WATTERS: So...
O'REILLY: This guy was actually working in the Obama administration.
WATTERS: Yes.
O'REILLY: He actually said the Republican Party wants to kill children?
WATTERS: We have it on tape.
O'REILLY: All right, I want to see that tape in "Reality Check" on Monday.
WATTERS: OK.
O'REILLY: All right? Jesse Watters, everybody. And I would buy that bulb if it sheds light. I buy these bulbs, and you can't see anything! The moths can't find them!
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: If they're bright, I'll buy the bulb for 40 bucks! All right. Had to get that off my chest.
