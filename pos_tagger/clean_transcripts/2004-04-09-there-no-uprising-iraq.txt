Hi, I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching tonight. A short "Talking Points" memo because we want to get right to the Condoleezza Rice (search) testimony. Once again, the elite media have misled you. On the front pages of The New York Times, The L.A. Times and The Washington Post, the words "uprising in Iraq" are featured.
One problem, it's not an uprising. The Berlin Wall (search) deal was an uprising. The regular folks rebelling against an entrenched authority is an uprising. Militant attacks in Iraq are an insurgency, not an uprising. This kind of stuff makes me angry. The elite media often spins information to make editorial points. And that's really wrong. Let me read you an e-mail from a Marine in the middle of the Fallujah fighting to put things into perspective.
"We are kicking their butts out here. We took the initial punch and responded. The enemy is dying in great numbers. We Marines are attacking with a fury I myself had not imagined. While we did not anticipate this surge, we're comfortable we'll win the fight. Semper, fi, pk.."
Today in Iraq, there was less fighting and no uprising. "Talking Points" is confident the American military will crush the al-Sadr militia and subdue the town of Fallujah. Again, somebody alert the elite media. There is no uprising in Iraq.
The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day
In Glassport, Pennsylvania, some Christian actors presented an Easter (search) show.
But, instead of entertaining the kids with Easter bunny tales and stuff like that, the actors began whipping the Easter bunny and breaking his eggs.
Some parents were outraged, and when confronted, spokesperson Patty Bickerton said, "We wanted to convey that Easter is not just about the bunny ... it's about Jesus."
I'm going out on a limb here, but I do believe Jesus might think whipping the Easter bunny is ridiculous.
