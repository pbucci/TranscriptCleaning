The American left parties in Washington, that is the subject of this evening's "Talking Points Memo."
This week, the very liberal Campaign for America's Future is holding its Take Back America conference in D.C. The crowd includes most of the Democratic presidential contenders and the usual suspects on the left, including Nancy Pelosi and Jesse Jackson.
"Talking Points" applauds get-togethers like this. If you believe something, you should get involved, no matter what side you're on. That's the real American way.
Now some at the conference don't like us, but some do. To sort it all out, we sent producers Nate Fredman and Griff Jenkins to the scene.

GRIFF JENKINS: Can we get you on "The O'Reilly Factor," sir?
SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, I'm sure at some point we will. Now you guys already did this to me once. See, you guys are filming me - hey, Bill, how are you?
GRIFF JENKINS: Can I get you on "The O'Reilly Factor?”
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He actually has to go right in.
GRIFF JENKINS: Can we get you on?
HOWARD DEAN, DNC CHAIRMAN: Sorry to disappoint.
GRIFF JENKINS: You know it’s fair and balanced, and we’ll just get you on the show tonight. You have an open invitation.
GRIFF JENKINS: We just wanted to get you on "The O'Reilly Factor." Can we get you on the show?
SEN. JOHN EDWARDS (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I’m sorry. I have to go.
GRIFF JENKINS: Is there any chance that you would ever come on with Bill O'Reilly?
JOHN MURTHA (D), PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSMAN: Well, I don't know. Has he asked us to come on?
GRIFF JENKINS: Many times.
MURTHA: I don't know. We're very hesitant to go on.
GRIFF JENKINS: Hey Senator, Griff Jenkins with FOX News. This is an "O'Reilly Factor" hat. Can we give you the hat? We’d like to have you on.
SEN. HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thanks. Bye.

I think she just pushed him. She didn't want the hat. Should have taken the hat.
Now as you may know, far left fanatics like MoveOn have actually threatened some Democrats that bad things will happen to them if they talk with FOX News. And that's serious.
We know John Edwards caved in right away. We have suspicions about Governor Bill Richardson. But we're hoping most of the Democratic leaders will have the courage to say no to this despicable blackmail.
And if the left really wants to take back America, they'll reject far left smear websites and pundit character assassins, because what those guttersnipes do is definitely not the American way. And that's “the Memo.”
Most Ridiculous Item
Time now for "The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day." Purdue University has completed a study about what happened on 9/11 and has concluded the Twin Towers collapsed because the hijacked planes that crashed into them stripped away critical fireproofing material. In other words, it was not an inside job.
Somebody send the study to Rosie O'Donnell and Charlie Sheen. But those people wouldn't believe it anyway, because they don't want to believe it, which, of course, is ridiculous.
