The answer seems to be no. The Obama administration does not want to tell us, we the people, what happened in Benghazi, Libya, how the IRS got so far out of control, and what exactly the feds are doing snooping around private communications. We are being stonewalled.
Here are some facts to support my assertion. The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper misled us when he said this on March 12th.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. RON WYDEN (D), OREGON: Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: No, sir.
WYDEN: It does not?
CLAPPER: Not wittingly.
I was asked a "when are you going to stop beating your wife" kind of question which is meaning not answerable necessarily by a simple yes or no. So, I responded in what I thought was the most truthful or least untruthful manner by saying no.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: The least untruthful manner, Mr. Clapper? Is that what you think your duty is to tell us the least untruth? Clapper knew the NSA was collecting all kinds of data. He knew that and purposefully did not tell the truth.
And then we have FBI Director Robert Mueller. He is in charge of finding out why the IRS targeted conservative groups and individuals.

REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO: Can you tell -- can you tell me some basics? Can you tell me how many agents -- investigators you have assigned to the case?
ROBERT MUELLER, FBI DIRECTOR: I may be able to do that but I would have to get back to you.
JORDAN: Can you tell me who the lead investigator is?
MUELLER: Off the top of my head, no.
JORDAN: This is the most important issue in front of the country of the last six weeks you don't know who is heading up the case, who the lead investigator is?
MUELLER: At this juncture no, I do not know.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Mueller doesn't know? Are you kidding me? Surely he knew he would be asked about the IRS investigation in front of the judiciary committee, surely he knew that. If Mueller doesn't know, specifics about the IRS investigation, it's because he doesn't want to know.
It's the old deniability deal. Gee, I don't know anything about it even though I'm in charge. So where have we heard that before?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: And it's also been reported that the Associated Press refrained from releasing in story for a week until the department confirmed that doing so would not jeopardize national security interests. That indicates that the AP was amenable to working with you on this matter. If that is the case, why was it necessary to subpoena the telephone records? Did you seek the AP's assistance in the first place and if not why not?
ERIC HOLDER, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Again, Mr. Chairman I don't know what happened there about with the interaction between the AP and the Justice Department. I was recused from the case.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Holder is Mueller's boss yet, he doesn't know anything about snooping on reporters. He hasn't heard anything about it. This is an insult to the intelligence of all Americans. So it's clear the Obama administration is not going to aggressively investigate the controversies. Not going to do it.
Therefore, Congress must do it. We can't rely on the FBI, the CIA, the IRS, or anybody else in the federal bureaucracy to tell us the truth. Sadly, there will have to be special prosecutors appointed in almost all of the cases. And of course, that will be slow going.
By the time we know what really happened, President Obama will be finishing up his second term. So you can see the strategy here. Is this the way the United States government should be running? You make the call.
And that's "The Memo."
