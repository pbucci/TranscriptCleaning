UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't like him.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: Obama.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The fellow playing first base for St. Louis.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He doing not so good, you know. He's trying to do something but he's not really good right now, you know.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm supporting Obama because, I think, he is working for poor people.
WATTERS: What's so good about Obama.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's different.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: He's different.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
WATTERS: That's for sure. What do you like about the President.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: About who.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm telling you who is on first
WATTERS: Now, you're from a Communist nation. Do you think Obama is a Communist.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't think so.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who.
WATTERS: Obama.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the man's name.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I guess, he is trying to turn this into a Socialist country.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obama is not a Communist. How do you know that.
JOE PESCI, HOLLYWOOD ACTOR: Are you sure.
WATTERS: Now, is he Christian or is he Muslim.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think he's a foreigner.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who.
WATTERS: Obama.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who is on first.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: His name is Hussein. That's a Muslim name. Christian names are bible names.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I said it and I ain't taking it back neither.
WATTERS: Mitt Romney, what have you heard about him.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The only thing I know is he used to live one time in Mexico.

WATTERS: Yes, what's that.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Serious and don't play.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's your textbook Republican
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to vote for Mitt Romney.
WATTERS: You are.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Definitely.
WATTERS: There's nothing wrong with having a lot of dough, right.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the guy got so much money, why would he be president. That's a lot of stress.
MIKE MYERS, HOLLYWOOD ACTOR: Feel extreme relaxation.
WATTERS: When I say the word "Republican," what do you think of.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Pepsi.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is that a great new Pepsi can or what.
WATTERS: Are you a fan of THE FACTOR.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Very big fan of THE FACTOR. Bill O'Reilly is the man.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi, Bill. I love you.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's nothing that Obama do is good but then Bill O'Reilly, all right.
O'REILLY: I mean, you've got to wise up.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: Every time we end these, you shake your head.
O'REILLY: I know, Watters. The audience is going to blame me, not you, all right. When you went out there, the consensus was Romney or Obama.
WATTERS: Seventy-thirty Obama. The Obama is an emotional connection with the ethnic background. He reaches out to poor people in the amnesty play. But, I tell you what, Romney's father was born in Mexico.
O'REILLY: Right.
WATTERS: I had a lot of Latin American immigrants tell me that. They know about that.
O'REILLY: They know that.
WATTERS: So that's making an impression.
O'REILLY: When you go out and you talk to people who aren't born in the United States -- a lot of people know more than the regular folks who were born here.
WATTERS: I know.
O'REILLY: OK. They know more about what's going on. They've kind of a heightened interest in the news of the day. Did you find them.
WATTERS: Yes. The taxicab drivers listen to a lot of radios, so they're always tuned in. Some of the interviews I did -- you know, it's spring break, I'd say, "What do you think about Mitt Romney." And they'd say, "Who." No one said that this time. So, these guys are pretty --
O'REILLY: So, the one guy who didn't know who Barack Obama was -- the Abbot Costello guy who kept going back, that was a put on.
WATTERS: No, I think that was a language barrier. I think it's a language barrier. The guy was from Colombia.
O'REILLY: OK, so what language doesn't understand Barack Obama.
WATTERS: I don't know.
O'REILLY: What language doesn't understand that.
WATTERS: Maybe it was the way I was pronouncing it. Who.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: All right. Watters, everybody, unleashed. With apologies to Joe Biden.
