BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "Back of the Book" segment tonight: A segment not for kids, so if they're in the room, please change the channel.
There's a strong movement in America right now to legalize marijuana. In fact, pot has been made widely available under the medical marijuana ruse. Two strong advocates for the weed are comedians Cheech and Chong, whom I spoke with a couple of days ago.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: I remember you guys when I was in college, and you know, you were doing the routine then. Isn't it easier to get laughs when everybody's stoned in the audience?
TOMMY CHONG, COMEDIAN: Hopefully.
O'REILLY: You guys have a big advantage. Then you can do anything, and they're going to go crazy.
Now, the marijuana legalization is really taking off under this medical marijuana ruse.

CHONG: It's a ruse to help sick people.
O'REILLY: No, but there's a lot of people that aren't sick…
CHONG: Absolutely.
O'REILLY: …that buy the buds, because they can buy it.
CHONG: But boredom is a disease, too.
O'REILLY: Boredom is a disease? That's interesting: Boredom is a disease. See, everyone? I told you that.
We found out that in San Francisco, which leads the league in marijuana clinics, medical marijuana clinics, a lot of hard-core drug addicts go in there, buy the pot and sell it to kids so they can buy their heroin and meth and everything else.
CHONG: Sell it to kids?
O'REILLY: Yes.
CHONG: Where did you get that information?
O'REILLY: We got it from our undercover people. In fact, they closed down so many marijuana clinics in San Francisco because of the problems that they've been having. So my question is to you, Cheech, children, you don't want them smoking pot, do you?
CHEECH MARIN, COMEDIAN: No. Absolutely not. I don't want them drinking beer either. I don't want them glugging champagne.
O'REILLY: You don't want them taking intoxicants?
MARIN: At the legal age whether it's 18, some states, 21 in other states. This is something an intoxicant for our — half past your generation. And I think should not be a law against it. It's not going to — if you want to have a referendum, we're going to have a referendum: beer or weed.
O'REILLY: Well, look, beer is legal. And alcoholism is tough. Ten percent of the population is addicted to alcohol. But you don't want children to smoke pot. Is that correct?
MARIN: True. Yes.
O'REILLY: You don't want them to smoke pot.
CHONG: Here's the thing: Marijuana is a proven medicine.
O'REILLY: The Constant (ph) people at Columbia University, who research drugs, say that marijuana is now the top addiction of American teenagers, the top addiction.
CHONG: Addiction?
O'REILLY: Addiction.
CHONG: Physical addiction?
O'REILLY: No, mental addiction or whatever it may be. I don't care what adults do. I don't care if they smoke pot. Don't care. Children, I think it's pernicious; it's harmful. And then you guys go out and you're funny, and make it seem like it's a lot of fun, and kids see it. Have you ever thought about that?
MARIN: Well, I have, because I have three kids, and I go through the regular things that every parent does. I want my kids to grow up to be a useful citizen.
O'REILLY: Do you smoke pot in front of them?
MARIN: No. No, I don't.
O'REILLY: When they ask you, they say, "Dad, do you smoke a lot of pot?" And you say?
MARIN: Well, they see my movies.
O'REILLY: When the kid says to you, "Hey, why are you telling me I can't smoke pot when you do?" You say what?
MARIN: Because I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
O'REILLY: So it's an age thing?
MARIN: It absolutely is. I wouldn't want them to raid my liquor cabinet and glug down my bourbon either. Same thing.
O'REILLY: So you see it the same way?
CHONG: Actually, I — I see it a little bit different. I'd rather have my kid smoking pot than drinking.
O'REILLY: Have you (UNINTELLIGIBLE)
CHONG: It's a personal thing. I have no idea.
O'REILLY: But do you have kids?
CHONG: Yes.
O'REILLY: OK.
CHONG: Five.
O'REILLY: Fifteen, 16, would that be OK with you?
CHONG: No.
O'REILLY: Do you smoke pot every day?
CHONG: Almost.
O'REILLY: All right. Now, the main message to America on — when you go out, what is the message?
CHONG: Get it legal.
MARIN: Change it from a schedule-one drug to a schedule-two drug.
CHONG: Prescription only.
O'REILLY: Just prescription, not guys down at 7-11 who have a Big Gulp and a big joint.
(CROSSTALK)
MARIN: I like that.
O'REILLY: You like that?
MARIN: Convenience. Convenience is the American way.
O'REILLY: I think I should go out and be your opening act.
MARIN: I think so.
O'REILLY: I think I should open for you guys. That would be fair and balanced. Cheech and Chong everybody.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: All right. The Cheech and Chong "Get it Legal" comedy tour kicks off January 16 in, where else? Boulder, Colorado.
