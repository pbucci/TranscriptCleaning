On Tuesday, J. Christian Adams, who quit the Justice Department last month because Attorney General Holder would not prosecute some Black Panthers, testified before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.

Mr. Adams contends that three Black Panthers obviously broke federal law when they intimidated voters in Philadelphia.

BLACK PANTHER MEMBER: I was wondering why everybody was taking pictures, that's all.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. I mean, I think it might be a little bit intimidating that you have a stick in your hand. That's why.
BLACK PANTHER MEMBER: Who are you to decide?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, that's a weapon, so that's why I'm a little worried.
BLACK PANTHER MEMBER: Who are you to decide?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, I am a concerned citizen. I'm just worried that you might beâ€¦
BLACK PANTHER MEMBER: So are we. That's why we're here.

Mr. Adams and five other attorneys inside the Justice Department urged the attorney general to prosecute the Black Panthers, to no avail.
The question is: Why? The evidence clearly shows the men breaking the law, so why give them a pass?
"Talking Points" cannot answer that question, and Mr. Holder will not answer it either. Very disturbing, and President Obama should order his attorney general to clarify the matter.
There is more clarity on the federal lawsuit filed on Tuesday against the state of Arizona. The Obama administration contends that the state's new immigration law infringes upon federal law.
As you may know, Arizona wants state authorities to be able to question people about their nationality if they are involved in another police matter. President Obama says that could lead to racial profiling, but it is federal authority over immigration that the president is citing in the lawsuit. He simply believes the state of Arizona has no right to regulate illegal immigration, even though that state is suffering because of it.
This is a loser all day long for the president. Every poll shows the vast majority of Americans support Arizona's crackdown on illegal aliens. So why is the president once again going against public opinion?
Broadcaster Jorge Ramos may provide a clue. He is angry with President Obama for not passing immigration reform.

JORGE RAMOS, UNIVISION ANCHOR: President Barack Obama, he broke his promise. It's that simple. We were -- we've been waiting for 18 months for a change. We haven't seen change. Not only that, President Barack Obama has deported more people in his first year in office than George W. Bush in his last year in office.

"Talking Points" believes the president may be worried about losing the support of Hispanic-Americans, thus the legal action against Arizona. But l'm not so sure about the strategy. With about 70 percent of Arizonans supporting the new law, some of them must be Hispanic, so the president might be miscalculating.
Be that as it may, the truth is that, once again, Mr. Obama finds himself at odds with the folks -- never a good thing.
And that's "The Memo."
Pinheads & Patriots
According to a new Marist College poll, only 74 percent of Americans know that America achieved independence by defeating England. Twenty-six percent of us do not know that and, yes, you are pinheads.
