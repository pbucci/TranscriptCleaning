Plenty of criticism floating around over the new Affordable Healthcare law and much of the anger flowing into the White House as President Obama's approval ratings continue to drop fast.
The whole thing began on March 23rd, 2010 -- more than three and a half years ago. At the White House, Vice President Joe Biden congratulating President Obama on his signature achievement.

JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Tens of millions of Americans will be a whole lot healthier from this moment on.
Ladies and gentlemen -- the President of the United States of America Barack Obama.
This is a big (EXPLETIVE DELETED) deal.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: And it was. For the first time in American history the feds calling the shots on healthcare. The Obama administration had three and a half years to launch the law -- more than enough time. It also spent a $1 billion on the launch -- more than enough money. Yet the entire thing is a catastrophe so far and no one, no one has been held responsible for that catastrophe.
So that's where we are this evening it is safe to say that most Americans do not trust the new healthcare law nor do they trust President Obama to implement it properly.
Enter the conservative Project Veritas Group, Veritas meaning truth. It sent an undercover person to the National Urban League offices in Dallas in Irving, Texas. The Urban League is receiving more than a million taxpayer dollars to guide people into Obamacare system. Some of that money is being used to hire so-called navigators. So when you call up they can help you.
The Project Veritas Undercover talked to a few of these navigators in training. First, about what to state as income.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The offer stuff I do is like barber or I'll go and clean houses and things like that just to get extra money on the side but I have never filed that type of stuff on my you know --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you file taxes.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On my file, file my taxes.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You are supposed to file a percentage of it?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A percentage.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because you are making money on a cash basis.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ok.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Don't get yourself in trouble by declaring it now.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. It didn't happen.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Yuck, yuck, yuck. So that navigator in training suggesting fraud.
On another occasion, the Project Veritas Undercover asked about smoking.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, one more question. They have -- I don't know where it says -- it said something about if you smoke or something like that. I really don't smoke I may --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You lie because your premiums will be higher.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
O'REILLY: You lie. So this time the navigator is suggesting deceit. Fraud and deceit -- sounds like a great federal program.
Going forward the President should delay the Affordable Healthcare Act for a year. In that time the computers could be fixed and responsible people -- responsible people, hired that could guide Americans through the healthcare maze.
I'm a simple man as you know. If this is a good program, the folks are going to know it so there is no threat to the Affordable Healthcare Act with a delay, none. In fact, the program should be stronger a year from now, right, Mr. President? Let's delay it.
And that's "The Memo."
