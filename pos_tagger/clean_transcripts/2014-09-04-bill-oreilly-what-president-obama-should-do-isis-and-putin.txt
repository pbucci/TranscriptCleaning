The ISIS terror Nazis have murdered a second American, Journalist Steven Sotloff, as with James Foley, two weeks ago. They posted the beheading on the net for the entire world to see. Proving once again that Muslim terrorists are as barbaric as the Third Reich ever was.
By killing two Americans has declared war on the U.S.A. So, President Obama and congress should declare war on them and other Muslim Terror Groups. America has declared war 11 times in its history, the last being World War II. Congress must pass the war resolution. The President must then sign it. So, let us get going, people.
If President Obama does not -- does not formally declare war on Muslim terrorism, he is doing all Americans a great disservice. We need a send a powerful message to the world and stop the nonsense. You simply cannot have a group of people murdering Americans for political reasons. That is an act of war, period.
One caveat, once war is declared, you fight it smart. No need to occupy countries as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan. You hit the terrorists in all kinds of ways. The declaration just means the world knows we mean business. Talking points hopes President Obama will stop his confused posture, his stammering, stuttering.
His statement last week that he still does not have a strategy to combat ISIS speaks for itself. An ISIS strategy should have been in place months ago. So, there is no question that Mr. Obama does not want to wage war. He wants to punt, to deflect the attack on Americans onto the international community.

PRES. OBAMA: We know that if we are joined by the international community, we can continue to shrink ISIL's sphere of influence, its effectiveness, its financing, its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem. And, the question is going to be making sure we got the right strategy but also making sure that we have got the international will to do it.

O'REILLY: That statement is irresponsible. The President was elected to protect America and Americans. The international community has nothing to do with that. Now, if Mr. Obama can rally the civilized world to help us, great. But you do not refuse to take protective action because places like Italy and India will not join in.
It is long past time for all Americans to demand that their President protect them. It is that simple. Teddy Roosevelt's basic philosophy was, "Speak softly and carry a big stick." With the Obama administration we basically have, "Speak incessantly and carry nothing."

JOSEPH ROBINETTE "JOE" BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: As a nation we are united and when people harm Americans, we do not retreat. We do not forget. We take care of those who are grieving. And, when that is finished, they should know, we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice, because hell is where they will reside. Hell is where they will reside.

O'REILLY: I am sure that has ISIS quaking. Despite the dangerous chaos overseas some on the left continue to give the President cover. "New York Times" Columnist, Thomas Friedman, usually a level-headed guy who wrote today that ISIS is not, not a threat to the American homeland. Amazing.
What is Mr. Freidman talking about? These people have sworn to kill Americans anywhere in the world. Is that not a threat? Freidman also says that President Obama should not overreact and that is the liberal line. The President Bush overreacted in Iraq and hurt the nation. The other liberal line is we cannot antagonize the terrorists.

MEDEA BENJAMIN, AMERICAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST: Every time there is a drone strike, that is the best recruiting tool for Al Qaeda. This guarantees the cycle of violence will go on.

KIRSTEN POWERS, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Every time we kill the number one person, there is another number one person. You are creating more terrorists.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: Every time you kill an innocent family then almost all of the young men at least in that family is going to be aroused with absolute and total hatred of America and a desire for vengeance.

O'REILLY: Now, all Americans should absolutely understand two things. Number one, Muslim terrorism preaches that murdering Americans is good. And number two, that President Obama has been far too passive in the face of grave threats to the nation. And, that brings us to the Russian villain Putin. His troops have now invaded Ukraine. This after Russia seized the Crimea.
Once again, President Obama is calling for international consensus to deal with Putin. Once again, the President is not leading the effort to stop the Russian tyrant. He is waiting, taking meetings, considering. It is worth noting that 75 years ago this week, Adolf Hitler invaded Poland starting World War II.
Putin is using the Hitler playbook moving his forces into weaker countries to seize territory. Hitler knew Europe was weak. He knew he could do pretty much whatever he wanted to do. Putin realizes the same thing. Europe is weak. And, president Obama has no stomach for confrontation.
Talking points understands you cannot confront Russia militarily over Ukraine. But you can certainly arm the Ukrainians. And, Mr. Obama refuses to do that. Also, the U.S.A should begin moving missiles into NATO countries as a warning.
And, finally as talking points said months ago, the American banking system should refuse to accept any credit card receipts from Russia. That would break the Russian economy. When you think about it, President Obama seems to be intimidated by Putin. Mr. Obama also seems to be confused about how international terrorism can destabilize the entire world.
It is obvious the President has not thought these things through. HE has no strategy to confront them and is putting America in danger. Or am I wrong? And that is "The Memo".
