It's really a shame -- really a shame that some Americans cannot allow the families of the Santa Barbara victims to grieve without politics. There is a time and place to make political points but you don't do it on the backs of innocent people who were killed in a rampage. But that's exactly what has happened this week.
Yesterday, a memorial service was held in California for six Americans murdered by Elliot Rodger last Friday -- obviously a heart breaking situation. These young people did nothing to Mr. Rodger, the crazed killer.
In addition to the dead, he hurt 13 other people. As "Talking Points" has stated, there is no way to stop mass murder, no way. Even in countries like Norway, which is very peaceful and has little gun intrusion, a psycho murdered 77 human beings a few years ago. If somebody wants to kill, they will find a way.
But for some reason, crazy ideologues feel they need to exploit these situations. We begin with this woman, Brittney Cooper who teaches gender and Africana studies at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Miss Cooper is a far left loon writing articles that associate "Duck Dynasty" with racism that kind of thing.
On the net Cooper writes quote "How many times must troubled young white men engage in these terroristic acts that make public space unsafe for everyone before we admit that white male privilege kills?" Unquote.
White male privilege kills? That's just insane. These murders had nothing to do with white privilege. It was some young guy unhinged. He actually killed himself. Is that white privilege, too? Ms. Cooper conveniently overlooks that murder is color blind.
In Chicago thousands of people, thousands have been murdered in the public space over the last few years. And 70 percent of the killers are black; 70 percent, Miss Cooper. So you, madam, are exploiting the Santa Barbara atrocity and trying to ramp up racial hatred to boot. And Rutgers puts that person in the classroom?
And then there is Mark Potok from the Southern Poverty Law Center. He blames the killing on Internet sites where frustrated men vent about women.

POTOK: There is whole world known as the manosphere of these sites. There are scores and scores of these sites if not hundreds of them. And the thing that is most prevalent and the thing that's most noticeable about them is they are often really extreme misogyny. But this is a world that in fact has produced a number of mass killers.

O'REILLY: Misogyny being hatred of women. So an Internet site provokes Rodger into going berserk. We expect more from Mr. Potok than that. The harsh truth is we're living in a world where more and more people are becoming mentally ill. The reason for that, excuse me, is alienation -- families falling apart, pervasive technology that numbs human feelings and a culture that too often celebrates violence.
Boundaries are broken down. But it has nothing to do with racism or bias against women. It has to do with individuals who are so sick they want to destroy other people as well as themselves. Sometimes those people can be helped, sometimes they can't be. Again no matter what society does, there will always be mass murder -- always.
And that's "The Memo."
