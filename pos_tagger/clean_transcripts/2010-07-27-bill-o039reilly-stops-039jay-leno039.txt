LAURA INGRAHAM, GUEST HOST: In the "Personal Story" segment tonight: The No Spin Zone invades L.A. Not only am I hosting "The Factor" from L.A. this week, but Bill O'Reilly himself showed up on "The Tonight Show" with Jay Leno last night. Here now some of the highlights of his chat with Jay.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JAY LENO, HOST, "THE TONIGHT SHOW": You were spotted at, was it Yankee Stadium with your entourage?
BILL O'REILLY: Yes.
LENO: We have a picture. Show that picture. I'll tell you why this -- I'll tell you why this fascinates me.
O'REILLY: Yes.
LENO: Who do you have more in common with: Geraldo or Glenn Beck?
O'REILLY: Neither.
LENO: Neither?
O'REILLY: No. They paid me a lot of money to go with them to the game.
LENO: OK. So you don't actually hang with them.
O'REILLY: No.
LENO: You don't hang with them.
O'REILLY: This is like a corporate date. You know, you get those? They pay you a lot of money, you go to the game with them.
LENO: It looks like Tony Hayward is out now or he's outâ€¦
O'REILLY: This pinhead, unbelievable. He's the head of BP, right? So he screws up everything and then says, "When am I going to get my life back?" I would have just jammed him in the hole right then. Then -- then, it gets worse. Then they pull him out, the Brits pull him out of BP, send him back to London. And where is he the next day? On his yacht.
LENO: A yacht race.
O'REILLY: On his yacht.
LENO: So who would you like to have as a guest on your show you have not been able to get? Maybe I can help you. I can make a phone call.
O'REILLY: Would you, Jay? You're such a kind man.
LENO: Who are you trying to get?
O'REILLY: Lady Gaga.
LENO: Lady Gaga. What is her position on Afghanistan? Have you heard?
O'REILLY: I don't know.
LENO: Why?
O'REILLY: But she is an unbelievable marketer. I mean, here's somebody -- and she has some catchy tunes. I mean, but she's basically Madonna lite.
LENO: Catchy tunes?
O'REILLY: Catchy tunes. You know what I mean?
LENO: You sound like a dad. You sound like a dad.
O'REILLY: I'm an old guy. Man, that's far out. She's pretty groovy. All right.
LENO: Now you're really an old guy.
O'REILLY: She's -- that's me. Not pretending. No Botox. She's an unbelievable marketer. She's basically Madonna lite, all right? She's almost the same kind of thing. Couple of catchy tunes, couple of shock things thrown in.
LENO: Yes.
O'REILLY: But she -- she's got to be very intelligent underneath the Lady Gaga-ness.
LENO: Let me ask you about Lindsay Lohan. Does she deserve jail time?
O'REILLY: Look, this is a woman who's on a Marilyn Monroe tract. Monroe died at 36. And she's from Long Island where I'm from. Very talented actress.
LENO: Oh, yes.
O'REILLY: If you've seen her, she is talented. But she is very, very confused right now, all right? And she can't stay away from the substance abuse. So, if I were the judge, I would have done exactly the same thing. Send her in. Got to send a message. But this woman needs to be saved. And I think we should stop with the tabloid stuff. Stop enjoying this kind of stuff. She's a human being. She's a human being. And I think she's 24 years old. I think she's been exploited by her parents. Nothing worse. Nothing worse on this Earth than being exploited by your parents. And I just hope and I pray, I do -- I've said some prayers for her -- that she can get out of there, find somebody, somebody to basically say, "Listen, Lindsay, knock it off, all right? Be an actress. You're a talented actress. Hollywood will give you another chance, and so will the American public." The American public is very forgiving. Redemption is big in this country.
LENO: Yes.
O'REILLY: So let's all hope she gets on the right track.
LENO: That's good. That's good. Now who do you see running for president, quickly, in 2012? Who do you like?
O'REILLY: I think Romney probably has the best chance right now for the GOP.
LENO: Yes, that seems...
O'REILLY: He's got a lot of money. He's a savvy guy. He's going to run on, "Look, I can turn the economy around." Here's a wild card. Does Hillary Clinton challenge Obama for the Democratic nomination? Possibly. If Obama's approvals fall into the thirties -- he's in the mid 40s now.
LENO: What do you think of this? Say Biden steps aside...
O'REILLY: Biden is never going to step aside.
LENO: Hillary becomes vice president.
O'REILLY: That's not going to happen, Jay. I mean, no. It's not going to happen. Never happen. No. 1, Biden will never step aside.
LENO: So if it does happen, you will come on my show and apologize to me?
O'REILLY: I will apologize to you. All right.
LENO: Bill, thank you very much.

INGRAHAM: Very fun.
