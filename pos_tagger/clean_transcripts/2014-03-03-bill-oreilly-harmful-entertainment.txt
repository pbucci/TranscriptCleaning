If you saw The Factor last night, you know that President Obama has launched a huge initiative to help children at risk targeting young black men especially. Called My Brother's Keeper -- it's a good initiative as we discussed with the President's senior advisor Valerie Jarrett.
If you missed the interview it is posted on BillOReilly.com.
But what is missing -- what is missing is the entertainment factor. There is no question that dubious music and movies are affecting unsupervised children of all colors. The hip hop industry makes billions putting out stuff like this.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I ball so hard (EXPLETIVE DELETED) want to fine me. First (EXPLETIVE DELETED) got to find me. What's 50 grand to a (EXPLETIVE DELETED) like me. Can you please remind me? Stop all that (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Early morning cartoon (EXPLETIVE DELETED). This is that (EXPLETIVE DELETED). (EXPLETIVE DELETED) up your whole afternoon (EXPLETIVE DELETED).
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Driver, roll up the partition, please I don't need you seeing once on your knees took 45 minutes to get all dressed up. We aren't even going to make to this club. Now my mascara running red lipstick smudged. Oh he's (EXPLETIVE DELETED) yes he wants to (EXPLETIVE DELETED). He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse. Monica Lewinsky-ed all of my gown.

O'REILLY: Now, if you can't see that unsupervised children might be harmed by that kind of stuff, then you are not a responsible person -- period. In order to help children at risk, the American society has got to convince them to stop destructive behavior. Like using drugs, committing violence, getting pregnant outside of marriage. I made that point to President Obama himself and to Miss Jarrett last night.
But after the President's announcement, it took only hours for the apologists and the enablers to show themselves.

MICHAEL SKOLINK, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF GLOBALGRIND.COM: The fact that this perpetuation of young black men, whether you are famous or not famous is you are a thug or you are a gangster because, what because you listen to rap music. Rap music is the reflection of our society.
BERNARD SHAW, FORMER CNN ANCHOR: O'Reilly is uncomfortable with this culture. That's understandable. He did not come from this culture. That culture has some validities if you will.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Sure -- validities. The overall effect of base entertainment is a corruption of impressionable children but you will never ever get the far left and many in the entertainment industry to admit that. The uber left will not make judgments. The industry simply wants to make money. I guarantee you I will be attacked for my stand on this issue because potentially I could disturb the money flow.
Yesterday, I asked the First Lady Michelle Obama, a well-respected woman in the black community to discuss this issue with me. I hope she does. If Mrs. Obama would put energy to try and to persuade children at risk not to succumb to the corrupting culture, that would be enormous. The My Brother's Keeper initiative is a very positive thing for this country. But unless it is coupled with a change in the entertainment culture, it will not reach nearly as many children as it should. And that's "The Memo."
