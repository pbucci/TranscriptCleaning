As you may know, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, a high school senior in Sanford, Florida shot dead a few weeks ago by 28-year-old George Zimmerman who was acting as a neighborhood watch guy.
Zimmerman said he shot the teenager because he felt the young man was a danger to him. There is a law in Florida that allows folks to use deadly force if they feel threatened. So, Zimmerman has not been charged with any crime and continues to carry the weapon that killed Trayvon.
Today President Obama said this:

PRESIDENT OBAMA: This is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through. And when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids. And I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this.

O'REILLY: Now, it is wrong to convict any American on television but that's what's happening on some other news stations. We are not going to do that here. But I am going to play you a 911 call made by Zimmerman that may contain a racial slur. It's hard to determine. Roll the tape.

GEORGE ZIMMERMAN: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) He's running.
DISPATCHER: He's running? Which way is he running?
ZIMMERMAN: Down towards the other entrance of the neighborhood.
DISPATCHER: Ok. Which entrance is that that he's heading towards?
ZIMMERMAN: The back entrance. (EXPLETIVE DELETED)
DISPATCHER: Are you following him?
ZIMMERMAN: Yes.
DISPATCHER: Ok. We don't need you to do that.
ZIMMERMAN: Ok.

O'REILLY: Now, President Obama's verbal involvement in the case is appropriate. We simply cannot have American citizens gunned down on the street without resolution.
Last night the State of Florida appointed a special prosecutor and the Justice Department is looking into any civil rights angle there may be.
Again, "Talking Points" is not going to come to any conclusion. That is simply not fair. But I will say this... every decent American, every decent American should want justice in this case.
And that's "The Memo."

O'REILLY: That ought to spur enlistment. Semper fi. Ms. Perry, a "Patriot" for doing that video.
