While most Americans are good people, we do have our share of villains in this country. A good example is O.J.Simpson, a man who literally got away with murder.
I covered the trial and interviewed a couple of the jurors afterward. And there is no question that the non guilty verdict was race driven. The jurors told me they believe the cops wanted to take down a famous black man.
The physical evidence against Simpson was overwhelming. Nobody else had a motive in the case. And the vast majority of Americans understand that Simpson did murder his former wife and Ron Goldman.
So, when Simpson was arrested over the weekend, for armed robbery, many felt "karma" had kicked in and maybe Simpson would finally get some kind of formal punishment.
Obviously, Simpson's behavior since the murder trial has been abysmal. He's cavorted with questionable people, participated in that vile book where he explained how he would have killed his former wife "if" he did it, and has demonstrated that he's totally devoid of any conscience or judgment.
O.J. Simpson is quite simply a sociopath. That is, he doesn't have any feeling about anybody other than himself. According to a recent study, about four percent of human beings fall into the sociopath category.
In addition, Simpson remains a dangerous person. He has a vicious temper, low impulse control and a sense of entitlement. It's obvious he believes he can do whatever he wants, no matter who it hurts. But this time, Simpson may well go to jail. This audiotape should seal that deal:
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
O.J. SIMPSON: Don't let nobody out this room. Mother (BLEEP)! Think you can steal my (BLEEP) and sell it?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
SIMPSON: Don't let nobody out of here. Mother (BLEEP) you think you can steal my (BLEEP)?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (BLEEP) you. Mind your own business.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at this.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get over there.
SIMPSON: You think you can steal my (BLEEP)?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Backs to the wall.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was trying to get past you.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Walk your (BLEEP) over there.
SIMPSON: Think you can steal my (BLEEP)?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mike took it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You against the mother (BLEEP) wall.
SIMPSON: I know (BLEEP) Mike took.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Search him.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know what Brian's trying to prove.
SIMPSON: I always thought you were a straight shooter.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm cool. I am.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stand up.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, so.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get your mother (BLEEP) up.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stand the (BLEEP) up.

Now the saga of O.J. Simpson represents America at its worst. A famous man who committed an unspeakable crime, going unpunished, playing golf every day. Let's hope "karma" and the Las Vegas prosecutor join together, put Simpson in prison for as long as possible.
And that's “The Memo.”
Pinheads and Patriots
Time now for our "Pinheads and Patriots" segment. And by the way, we are looking for nominations from you, so you can e-mail them to us, if you have them.
Now, we want to applaud the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. They are over in Iraq right now, visiting our forces there. This is the 63rd time the squad has gone on a USO tour. More than any other entertainment group. So the ladies are patriots, no doubt.
On the pinhead front, our pal Nas, a rapper who embraces violence, continues to comment on me, your humble correspondent. Speaking to MTV about my criticizing him, quote, "When O'Reilly wants to come holla at me, be ready for Hannibal Lecter. He don't deserve an intelligent explanation. I'll bite off his nose!"
Indeed. Nas is a pinhead.
