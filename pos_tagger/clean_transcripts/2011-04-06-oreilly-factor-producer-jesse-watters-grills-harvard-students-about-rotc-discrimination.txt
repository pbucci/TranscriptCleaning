BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "Watters World" segment tonight: As you may know, Harvard University recently reinstated ROTC on campus. For decades, Harvard had rejected military recruitment of its students for a variety of liberal reasons. But once the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy was thrown out, Harvard relented. So we sent "Factor" producer Jesse Watters up to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to see how things are going.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JESSE WATTERS, "FACTOR" PRODUCER: Now, Harvard banned the ROTC. Now they're welcoming them back. What do you think about that?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If we lived in a society where we had a truly just leader, we wouldn't need the military.
WATTERS: If we had a really good president, we wouldn't need a military at all?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the Dalai Lama was president, things would be radically different.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Academia should be a place where you don't walk through the gates and see people in uniform,
WATTERS: So the ROTC is now allowed back on Harvard's campus.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I didn't know it was not allowed ever.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think militarization of our youth is something we should avoid at all costs.

WATTERS: Wouldn't you want Harvard students to be able to go into the military and have those opportunities?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They can. They can just not go to Harvard.
WATTERS: So how do you think the military is performing right now?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I honestly don't know.
WATTERS: So the people in Libya, the Obama administration is trying to help them.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Guess what? We blew up a bunch of people. We find out the people that are rebelling against Qaddafi are Al Qaeda. We're not ever leaving the Middle East, guys.
WATTERS: So if Al Qaeda wants to set off a dirty bomb, you don't want students at Harvard to be able to go into the ROTC?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Al Qaeda isn't real. The Al Qaeda is created by the CIA.

WATTERS: Who flew the planes into the World Trade Center?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The CIA.
WATTERS: That's extremely offensive.
President Obama has now started a third war with no congressional approval there. You're OK with that, right?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was mandated by the United Nations Security Council, unlike the war in Iraq.

WATTERS: So World War II or the Korean War or Vietnam, you're saying those are illegal wars?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The U.N. Security Council didn't exist.
WATTERS: Vietnam.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Was Vietnam an illegal and unjust war? I think a very good case could be made for the fact that was true, yes.

WATTERS: OK. So you're saying the United Nations is more of a moral force in the world than the U.S. military?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Certainly it's got problems.

WATTERS: I call that more than just a problem.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What would you call Guantanamo Bay? Are those just problems? You have a systematic removal of human lives, people who haven't been accused of a crime. That's against the very basic notions of justice.
WATTERS: Bill O'Reilly graduated from Harvard. What do you think about that?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I bet if we went head to head, it would be interesting.

WATTERS: Do you know O'Reilly graduated from Harvard?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know. I honestly don't even really know who he is.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bill O'Reilly is a great guy. Polarizing people is good.
WATTERS: So you're a "Factor" fan?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am a fan of freedom.

WATTERS: Thank you very much.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you very much. I like to talk.

O'REILLY: All right. Sometimes you can be too educated, and here now is Jesse Watters, who falls into that category. Three out of those five people were Harvard students.
WATTERS: Correct.

O'REILLY: And the guy with the beard wasn't a Harvard student.

WATTERS: No, he was not.

O'REILLY: I could tell right away that he wasn't paying tuition to Harvard. When the ROTC was brought back, they didn't make -- they made an announcement. There was one day when they made an announcement. But Harvard does have a fairly sophisticated history in military matters, right?

WATTERS: Harvard University has more Medal of Honor winners than any other school besides West Point and Annapolis. But it's interesting. If you go back to the 1969 Vietnam War, students at Harvard burned down a military training classroom at Harvard. So they're still struggling with the relationship with the military.

O'REILLY: I think that's accurate. When I was there at the Kennedy School of Government, many, many military officers were there getting more education about foreign affairs and things like that. They were paying the school. The school had no problem taking their money. OK. But then when they wanted to recruit, there's a problem. And therein lies the problem with Harvard.
WATTERS: And when I mentioned that you went to Harvard, a lot of people were shocked that you were accepted.

O'REILLY: Right.

WATTERS: And then shocked that you actually graduated.

O'REILLY: Well, I can't object because I was shocked that I was accepted, and I was more shocked that I graduated, so they're right on that.
All right. Watters, everybody, roaming around causing trouble.
