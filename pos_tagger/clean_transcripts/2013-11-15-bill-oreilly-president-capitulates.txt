Speaking at the White House, Mr. Obama once again said that the computer problems and other chaos surrounding Obamacare are his responsibility.

OBAMA: That's on me. I mean we fumbled the rollout on this health care law. There are a whole bunch of things about it that are working really well, which people didn't notice, all right, because they weren't controversial. We always knew that these marketplaces creating a place where people can shop and through competition get a better deal for the health insurance that their families need. We always knew that that was going to be complicated.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Ok but if you always knew, why didn't you tell we the people who had no idea? Instead, the introduction of Obamacare was sold for three and a half years as a magnificent government imposed program with little down side. That's why many folks are furious. While the President continued to praise the overall law as being good for most Americans he did address that overselling.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: With respect to the pledge I made that if you like your plan, you can keep it, I think and I've said in interviews that there is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate. It was not because of my intention not to deliver on that commitment and that promise. We put a grandfather clause into the law. But it was insufficient.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: True. But for weeks, that was not acknowledged by you, Mr. President. And only when powerful senators in your own party began introducing legislation to deal with health insurance problems did you respond. So in order to stop that legislation cold, the President is now saying this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: Insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be canceled into 2014 and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose reenroll in the same kind of plan.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: And that of course will cause even more chaos.
Let me see a show of hands. How many of you believe reenrolling in a canceled health insurance plan will be a fun adventure? Anyone? Bueller?
Going forward, Mr. Obama is anticipating even more problems. That was evident when he said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: I've said from the beginning I'm willing to work with Democrats and Republicans to fix problems as they arise. This is an example of what I was talking about. We can always make this law work better. I will not accept proposals that are just another brazen attempt to undermine or repeal the overall law and drag us back into a broken system.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Now that was a signal to Republicans that the President will veto any attempt to repeal Obamacare. No matter what happens, no matter how many problems develop, true believers in affordable health care law like the President will stand by it. It's the greater good proposition that even if Obamacare is screwed up beyond belief, it's better for Americans than what was there.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: I am not a perfect man and I will not be a perfect president. But I'll wake up every single day working as hard as I can on behalf of Americans out there from every walk of life, who are working hard meeting their responsibilities but sometimes are struggling because the way the system works isn't giving them a fair shot. And -- and that pledge I haven't broken.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Well, the old adage is careful what you wish for. All the king's horses and all the king's men might not be able to put Obamacare back together again. That's because it goes against free market principles. But more importantly, more importantly it depends on an efficient government bureaucracy to implement it. And in this country there is not nor has there ever been an efficient government bureaucracy.
The question is why don't some very intelligent people like the guy who designed Obamacare understand that?

KELLY: Going to the exchanges on their own because they saw it.
EMANUEL: Yes.
KELLY: And said I like it, it's better than what I have.
EMANUEL: Yes.
KELLY: That's not the same as the insurance company saying you are canceled and now you're on your own. Did you foresee that happening?
EMANUEL: That -- that is absolutely -- they have canceled because they don't see that as a --
KELLY: You're not answering.
EMANUEL: -- they don't see that as a growing market, that's their view.
KELLY: You are not answering.
EMANUEL: They think the exchange is rising.
KELLY: Sir, you're not answering. You're not --
(CROSSTALK)
EMANUEL: I am answering. Their business decision says the individual market is dying we're going to go to the exchange. That's how they're playing this.
KELLY: Ok so when -- when the President said to the people if you like your plan, you can keep it period, you believe he genuinely believed that in his mind and that he did not foresee the amount of cancellations we're seeing now --
EMANUEL: The affordable -- whether you could anticipate what business would do is irrelevant. The Affordable Care Act --
(CROSSTALK)
KELLY: Stop saying that because I'll tell you what's relevant to my view, I think I know my viewers and I think they think this is relevant.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Summing up, we can expect the President and his supporters like Dr. Emanuel to compromise on some small things. But not the overall Obamacare program which they will defend forever. To admit it's not good for the country would be to admit that big country is not good. Therefore, liberalism is not good. And that's what this is all about.
And that's "The Memo."
