BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "Culture Warrior" segment tonight: As you may know, BP has put $20 billion to help folks who have lost wages and earnings because of the oil spill. Now some New Orleans strippers say their business is off and want some of that dough.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KENNETH FEINBERG, ADMINISTRATOR OF BP CLAIMS FUND: I'm dubious about that claim. I'm very dubious about that claim. But I don't want to pre- judge any individual claim.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Dubious, meaning suspicious. Joining us now, the "Culture Warriors," "Fox & Friends" co-anchor Gretchen Carlson and Fox News analyst Margaret Hoover.
All right, Hoover, we'll begin with you. Now, I don't think there's any doubt that entertainment facilities like the club that these ladies work in, their business is off. I mean, you know, oil work is suspended. They're not drilling. Tourists, some of them not going down there. So they're losing some money. So should they get the BP bucks?

MARGARET HOOVER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, as much as if I found one of these strippers, I'd like to convince her to go into another profession, the reality is BP has already paid out $119 million in claims. Some of those claims have gone to many people who are in secondary or tertiary levels of the economic ecosystem. So you've got...
O'REILLY: The secondary ecosystem?
HOOVER: I said the economic ecosystem. In other words...
O'REILLY: Economic ecosystem.
HOOVER: Can I just -- so there's a gardener in Alabama who has gotten a BP payout because he's not getting as much business because the fishermen who are his clients are home doing the gardens because they're not out fishing. You have taxi drivers in New Orleans...
O'REILLY: Everybody, everybody on the Gulf Coast who has any business at all...
HOOVER: Right.
O'REILLY: ...is going to be influenced by this.
HOOVER: So as long as...
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Ecosystem aside, Hoover -- I love those -- you give them money or not?
HOOVER: Yes.
O'REILLY: OK. You give them money?
GRETCHEN CARLSON, CO-HOST, "FOX & FRIENDS: Well, all they have to do is prove the documentation. So my question is, what is the documentation?
O'REILLY: Well, it's how much money you make a week.
CARLSON: Well, but you could argue...
O'REILLY: Because these ladies work on tips, right?
CARLSON: Correct. You could argue though that business is down because we're in a recession. So I think it's going to be...
O'REILLY: Well, we were in a recession for three years, and now they can say, look, three months ago, this is how much money was coming into this place.
CARLSON: I'm just saying that I don't really give a rip because it's BP money. It's not taxpayer money.
O'REILLY: OK, but there's Feinberg...
CARLSON: If it were taxpayer money, I'd have a problem with it.
O'REILLY: Feinberg is -- he's dubious. Feinberg is dubious.
CARLSON: He didn't know how to answer the question because it was about strippers.
O'REILLY: All right. Are you dubious?
CARLSON: Not at all. I laughed out loud when I first read this story.
O'REILLY: OK. Would you give them the money?
CARLSON: Yes.
O'REILLY: OK. So both of you, the "Culture Warriors"...
HOOVER: Yes.
O'REILLY: ...are going to give the ladies the dough.
HOOVER: Well, it's actually the owners of the strip club, so...
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: ... has to go to them, too.
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: I wouldn't give the owners of the club jack.
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: I mean, it's the employees.
HOOVER: That's who's filing the claim.
O'REILLY: It's the bartenders. It's the janitors and everybody else, if they have to lay off some people or something like that. That's who should get the money.
HOOVER: If they're...
O'REILLY: The mob guys who own the place, the Mafia guys who own it -- come on.
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: And I'm not implying that this particular club is owned by the mob. I'm not doing that. I'm saying the industry itself is rife with that, and they're not getting anything.
All right. Father's Day celebrated at the White House. President Obama made a nice speech and said you should be a responsible dad. And then he sent all the dads over to a website, and the website is being a dad, tips for parents, all right? Let me read you some of the tips for parents.
Watch a game on TV with your kids. Cheer for your favorite team. OK. Bake a cake, cupcakes or cookies with your kids. Dad's baking the cake, all right? Turn off the water while you brush your teeth. I guess that's a big father thing. I'm not really sure. Buy compact fluorescent light bulbs. I guess this is going to bring your children together with you, the dad, if you buy light bulbs, correct?
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Hey, kids, let's go buy fluorescent light bulbs! Come on!
CARLSON: I'm going to take to you task on this. I don't see anything wrong with this.
O'REILLY: No?
CARLSON: OK? Here's some of the smartest things...
O'REILLY: So dads bond with their kids by buying light bulbs?
CARLSON: Doing anything together!
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Anything?
HOOVER: You are misrepresenting this.
CARLSON: You are misrepresenting this...
O'REILLY: I am?
CARLSON: ...because when you bake cupcakes, the point of that was to learn math skills because you're measuring things. You left that part out.
O'REILLY: Measuring and math? For the dad or the kids?
CARLSON: Let me make my political point, OK? Here's what else the president said when he revealed this new website. He said you can't legislate fatherhood. That's a brilliant comment, OK?
O'REILLY: All right.
CARLSON: He also said government cannot do what fathers can do best at home.
O'REILLY: OK.
CARLSON: And my reaction was, wow, finally, something that President Obama does not believe the government can do better!
O'REILLY: All right. So turning off the water while you brush your teeth is going to bring the dad closer...
HOOVER: That came from -- you're totally misrepresenting this. That -- you and I both know...
O'REILLY: No, I'm not.
HOOVER: You and I both know...
O'REILLY: I'm reading this right off the website. I'm not misrepresenting anything.
HOOVER: You and I both know that came from the green tips, in other words, environmentally friendly things to do with your family. So it's not like...
O'REILLY: I'm a green dad.
HOOVER: Are you really? Well, then, you...
O'REILLY: The Jolly Green Giant right here! I am a green guy.
CARLSON: Do you turn off the water when you brush your teeth?
O'REILLY: I do.
HOOVER: Here's...
O'REILLY: I do all that stuff!
CARLSON: Well, then, what...
O'REILLY: I recycle. I do all -- but I'm not baking a cupcake! I'm sorry.
CARLSON: Well, your kids will be for the lesser then because...
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: My kids will be for the lesser because I don't bake them a cupcake?
CARLSON: Yes! That would be fun, as well as...
O'REILLY: I'll buy them a cupcake!
CARLSON: ...some of these other things.
O'REILLY: I don't want to get flour all over me, or whatever you put in cupcakes.
HOOVER: Again, reinforcing traditional stereotypes for genders. I love it.
O'REILLY: OK.
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Can we get back to the ecosystem for a minute?
CARLSON: No, let's not!
HOOVER: The powers of persuasion...
O'REILLY: Yes?
HOOVER: ...rather than the power of legislation.
O'REILLY: So I'm going to persuade...
HOOVER: And that's what he's doing.
O'REILLY: Look, I'd like to see you persuade any kid to go buy a light bulb. I want to see you do that. Hey!
CARLSON: You know what...
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: Let's get in the station wagon and go!
CARLSON: Bill, what you're doing right now is what you accuse some of your guests of doing.
O'REILLY: Yes. What is that?
CARLSON: Which is to have a beef with Obama, no matter what he does.
O'REILLY: I'm not having any beef with Obama!
HOOVER: Spinning! Spinning!
CARLSON: And I'm just saying that...
O'REILLY: I'm just saying I don't get the light bulb thing.
CARLSON: Any time...
O'REILLY: I have no beef with anybody.
CARLSON: Any time that a father spends with a child is a good thing.
O'REILLY: All right. Good time. All right. I'm going to try the light bulb thing over the weekend.
(CROSSTALK)
HOOVER: And you know, kudos to him because he is being a role modelâ€¦
O'REILLY: All right, ladies. I'm getting a little headache right here.
