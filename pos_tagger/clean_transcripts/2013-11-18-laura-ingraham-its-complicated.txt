As Congress debated today whether to proceed legislatively to help the millions of Americans who have had their insurance policies canceled, I was thinking about one of the points the President kept making repeatedly at his Obamacare press conference.

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We always knew that that was going to be complicated and everybody was going to be paying a lot of attention to it. The truth is that this is, number one, very complicated. What we are also discovering is that -- that insurance is complicated to buy. Buying health insurance is never going to be like buying a song on iTunes. You know, it's just a much more complicated transaction.

INGRAHAM: Yes, it is complicated, sir. But you are just realizing that now? I was thinking imagine if the President was as committed to governing, to administering these programs as he has been to campaigning, he might have known two years ago maybe even that they didn't have the right team, or maybe even the right technology in place to carry off this grandiose mission of healthcare reform. The President had also -- has apparently learned another important fact during the past four and a half years, get this: government bureaucracies don't work well.

OBAMA: How we purchase technology in the federal government is cumbersome, complicated, and outdated. If you're doing it at the federal government level, you are going through you know 40 pages of specs and this and that and the other and there are all kinds of laws involved and it makes it more difficult, it's part of the reason why chronically federal IT programs are over budget, behind schedule.

INGRAHAM: He sounds like a conservative there. Wow. What a revelation. Government bureaucracies aren't as efficient as the free market. Does that sound familiar? That was one of the main reasons Republicans were united against Obamacare. Most of them at least understood what would have happened once the Washington bureaucracy started trying to implement the thousand page law that there would be terrible, unintended consequences for the American people. Consequences like policy cancellations, premium hikes, doctor shortages, that's just to name a few. Of course when conservatives made these arguments during the past five years they were called obstructionists and things like Tea Party fanatics and they recalled that by the President's Democrat enablers on Capitol Hill and the media. A serious president would have taken though the time to objectively examine Republican concerns about such a massive undertaking this piece of legislation. A serious President would have done the due diligence, ask the right questions, to make sure his plan's Web site was actually going to work on launch day.
A serious President would not see this current mess as a political problem to be managed. He'd see it as a national crisis.
And that's "The Memo."
