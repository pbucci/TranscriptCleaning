A new survey from the Pew Research Center says for the first time a majority of Americans want U.S. troops in Afghanistan brought home as soon as possible: 56 percent say that; 39 percent favor keeping troops in Afghanistan until the situation has stabilized there.
Americans continue to say that the war in Afghanistan was the right thing to do: 57 percent believe that, but 56 percent say it is unlikely that Afghanistan will be able to maintain a stable government after the U.S. military leaves.
Unfortunately, the war has now become political. President Obama knows he must get on the right side of the folks, and that is shading his Afghan policy. That's why he's withdrawing more troops quicker than the commander in the field, Gen. David Petraeus, wants. That is not good. As "Talking Points" said Tuesday night, the president should defer to Gen. Petraeus, who has been very successful in Iraq and now in Afghanistan.
But there is no question that Americans have pretty much had enough of fighting in Muslim nations. It has cost this country way too much in blood and treasure. In the future, as the president said, we must do things differently. Nation building is not possible any longer.
But since we've invested 10 years and more than a half-trillion dollars in Afghanistan, it would be foolish and irresponsible to allow the Taliban to win. I hope President Obama understands that. And if he loses next year, the new president must understand it as well.
And that's "The Memo."
