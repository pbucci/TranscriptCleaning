BILL O'REILLY, HOST: Now for the top story tonight, leading the charge against Van Jones was FOX News commentator Glenn Beck. And here he is, making trouble as always. You are a troublemaker.
GLENN BECK, HOST, "GLENN BECK": A troublemaker?
O'REILLY: You are.
BECK: I heard…
O'REILLY: You make me look like Mary Poppins.
BECK: I'm just taking my cues from you.
O'REILLY: No, you have now surpassed me in the troublemaking department.

BECK: I have to tell you, I was astounded this weekend that you can show Van Jones' own words where he is saying white people poisoned…
O'REILLY: The environment.
BECK: …of color…
O'REILLY: No, no, no.
BECK: White people are poisons and directing them into communities of color. Where he said give the wealth to the native Americans. Take it from people and give it to them.
O'REILLY: Give it over there.
BECK: He says all of these things. At midnight on Sunday morning…
O'REILLY: But isn't this a guy…
BECK: …he resigns.
O'REILLY: OK, yeah. I mean, they try to sneak it by everybody, but not us because we're always watching.
BECK: But the point is, Bill, the reason why we were looking into Van Jones, the reason why we were looking into all the people surrounding him is because when John McCain on the campaign trail said, you're a Marxist, you have all these Marxist ties, how do you feel about Jeremiah Wright? What did he say? Look at the people I surround myself with.
O'REILLY: Yeah, Warren Buffet…
BECK: Correct.
O'REILLY: …Shirley Temple.
BECK: That's what we're doing.
O'REILLY: Shirley Temple.
BECK: Shirley Temple and Warren Buffett are off.
O'REILLY: Joe Nameth.
BECK: They're here.
O'REILLY: Right, Derek Jeter.
BECK: They're not there anymore.
O'REILLY: No, OK. All right, but look, Beck, this guy, Van Jones, let's be honest about this.
BECK: Yeah.
O'REILLY: This was a guy who had like the lowest job you can have.
BECK: Not true.
O'REILLY: No, this was a guy who was sitting in a lawn chair…
BECK: Not true.
O'REILLY: ...all right, on the mall in Washington…
BECK: Not true.
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: No.
O'REILLY: Trying to get guys to rake up leaves to make it cleaner.
BECK: Not true.
O'REILLY: He wasn't a big guy.
BECK: This guy is full of — riddled with lies and distortions.
O'REILLY: He wasn't a big guy.
BECK: Yes, he was.
O'REILLY: No, he's not a big…
BECK: He was part of the Apollo project. The Apollo project is massive money from tides. They're the people that designed the stimulus package.
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: He's the guy who was directing the funds of the stimulus package. Even more important…
O'REILLY: Green jobs.
BECK: Absolutely. More important, this guy was — he is a very good speaker. He is.
O'REILLY: Oh, he was on "The Factor" a few years ago.
BECK: He's exceptional.
O'REILLY: Right.
BECK: He's exceptional. This guy, by just being in the White House, think of this, what message does it send to the youth of America that a Marxist anarchist self-avowed communist can work in the White House? Well, that says communism is…
O'REILLY: No, you know what it says to me? Equal opportunity employment.
BECK: Right.
O'REILLY: That's what it says.
BECK: That is one way — I didn't look at it that way, but that is one way to look at it.
O'REILLY: What I'm trying to — look, I didn't cover this Van Jones thing. And you've been covering it ostensibly because he's a little guy. It doesn't really matter to me.
BECK: May I come back — may I come back on your program and spend a little more time with you?
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: And bring to you the evidence.
O'REILLY: You don't have to convince me. I know who this guy is.
BECK: No, no, no. Not him, not him.
O'REILLY: Right.
BECK: How it all ties together. What Van Jones says about the administration, and not just Van Jones…
O'REILLY: We have three minutes to do it now. You don't have to come back. Give me the big picture. Why is Van Jones important?
BECK: I need a little romancing. I can't just — three minutes.
O'REILLY: Well, you ain't going to get that from me. No, no, I'm not even going to say it, OK. OK, give me the big picture.
BECK: The big picture is Barack Obama continues to surround himself with not just — we're not talking Democrats here. We are talking about radicals.
O'REILLY: Do you think Obama even knew the guy who worked in the White House?
BECK: Absolutely I do.
O'REILLY: How did you come to that conclusion?
BECK: Well, let — his — I'm trying to remember her title.
O'REILLY: Valerie Jarrett?
BECK: Yes.
O'REILLY: Thank you.
BECK: She is one of…
O'REILLY: She's a big…
BECK: She's the big cheese.
O'REILLY: Right.
BECK: She loves him.
O'REILLY: She loves him.
BECK: She loves him.
O'REILLY: Right.
BECK: Michelle Obama loved him.
O'REILLY: Loved who?
BECK: Van Jones.
O'REILLY: How do you know?
BECK: I read it in the paper.
O'REILLY: What paper?
BECK: I believe…
O'REILLY: You believe what you read in the paper? So you're telling me Michelle Obama loves Van Jones?
BECK: Michelle Obama, it was quoted yesterday that Michelle Obama, and this is from some — it may have been the Huffington Post, I'm not sure. But it was a lefty blog that said Michelle Obama was instrumental in getting him…
O'REILLY: Look, I don't…
BECK: I do. And Jarrett absolutely was.
O'REILLY: Well, Jarrett was.
BECK: And.
O'REILLY: We don't know about Michelle Obama. OK.
BECK: They vacationed together.
O'REILLY: OK, so your hypothesis, big word, but I feel can you handle it is that…
BECK: I can't spell it.
O'REILLY: ...he's a — the president.
BECK: Yeah.
O'REILLY: ...is a closet Marxist? I mean, how far are you taking this?
BECK: I don't know yet, Bill.
O'REILLY: But you're on the trail.
BECK: I think that Americans need to ask themselves the question, Bill, you're president of the United States. Would you have a man who was a self-avowed communist…
O'REILLY: No, I wouldn't.
BECK: Who said I'd rather lose the radical pose for the radical ends?
O'REILLY: Here's what did it for me. I don't even care about the dopey far-left politics. When he signed that petition about 9/11, that eliminates him from public service.
BECK: I don't understand that. When did we — America…
O'REILLY: Yeah.
BECK: ...when did we stop caring about communism?
O'REILLY: Because communism is not a threat to us anymore.
BECK: Are you kidding me?
O'REILLY: Unless, unless.
BECK: We're talking about a guy who is president of the United States saying I'm going to fundamentally transform America.
O'REILLY: OK, but that's what I'm trying to get at.
BECK: But what is he changing us to?
O'REILLY: You believe that Barack Obama wants a communist society?
BECK: If you look at the people he surrounded himself with, socialists, Marxists, Van Jones a self-avowed communist. If you look at what the Democratic Party has…
O'REILLY: But you just said you're not…
BECK: Hang on.
O'REILLY: …you're not sure yet. You're just going down the road.
BECK: Because I'm asking the questions that I think Americans need to ask.
O'REILLY: Oh, absolutely.
BECK: And Democrats, good Democrats…
O'REILLY: Should ask.
BECK: …they're not communists. They're not bad people.
O'REILLY: Now do you feel bad about getting this Van Jones fired?
BECK: No.
O'REILLY: Are you going to hire him for your set?
BECK: I don't know. No. I don't feel bad. I think it — people said to me this weekend congratulations. That's not congratulations. He's more dangerous outside of the administration because John Podesta came out with a statement today saying yeah, I'm going to be working with him.
O'REILLY: Of course.
BECK: He's going to be doing the bidding of the White House.
O'REILLY: Podesta is the people for the American Progress.
BECK: Yeah.
O'REILLY: Or some crazy left wing. All right, OK, Beck, thanks for coming on. We appreciate it. Stop causing trouble, man.
BECK: I'm trying.
O'REILLY: I'm getting nervous when…
BECK: You do it tonight.
