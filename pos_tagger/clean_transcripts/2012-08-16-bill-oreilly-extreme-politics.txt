The political world is aflutter... aflutter over the Obama campaign's negative posture. Many Republicans are aghast that people like Vice President Biden are saying stuff like this about their party.

JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT: Look at what they value and look at their budget and what they are proposing. Romney wants to let the -- he said in the first 100 days he's going to let the big banks once again write their own rules -- unchain Wall Street. They're going to put you all back in chains.

O'REILLY: 'Y'all'. Now, there were some for African-Americans in the audience. Thus, the slavery image was raised by Mr. Biden. Outrage followed.
But "Talking Points" is not outraged, maybe it's because I'm cynical but Biden is Biden. He says provocative stuff all the time. Does the Vice President really think Republicans want to enslave black Americans? No he does not. Does he really think? No, he does not. Just listen to Rudy Giuliani.

RUDY GIULIANI: I mean, this guy just isn't bright. He has never been bright. He isn't bright. And people think well he just talks a little too much. Actually, he is just not very smart.

O'REILLY: Please note Mayor Giuliani personally attacking the Vice President. That's what happens in national politics. Yes, it's wrong but it's been going on since John Adams ran against Thomas Jefferson.
Now to his credit, Mitt Romney is playing the assaults on him and Paul Ryan very well. You may remember Obama supporters accused Romney of contributing to the cancer death of a woman of failing to pay income taxes. And of abusing poor people by proposing to take their money and give it to folks like Donald Trump.
Here is how Romney replied today.

MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The President's campaign is all about division and attack and hatred. My campaign is about getting America back to work and creating greater unity in this country which of course has always been the source of America's vitality and strength.

O'REILLY: The question now becomes will the Obama campaign's over the top attack rhetoric actually hurt the President in the upcoming vote? Impossible to answer that question. But even the dimmest Americans must be noticing the vicious tone.
Just today in the "New York Times," columnist Maureen Dowd says Paul Ryan wants to hurt people. Do you think Mr. Ryan wants to hurt people? Do you think he gets up in the morning and says, "You know what? Today, I'm going to cause some pain." I mean come on. But the nonsense is happening and there will be consequences; we just don't know what they will be yet.
And that's "The Memo."
