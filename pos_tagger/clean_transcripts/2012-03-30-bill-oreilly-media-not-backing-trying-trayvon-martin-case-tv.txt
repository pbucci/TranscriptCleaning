Many pundits are demanding the 28-year-old George Zimmerman be arrested for shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin to death in Florida. And we can now add Oprah Winfrey to that list.

OPRAH WINFREY: It is a tragedy and it is a shame that we're sitting here 33 days later and there hasn't been an arrest or questioning of actually what happened. It's a tragedy and it is a shame and we all know it. Black people, white people, brown people, yellow people all over this country and all over the world are saying the same thing. It's a tragedy and it's a shame and justice needs to be served.

O'REILLY: Well, it is certainly a tragedy that Trayvon lost his life but Miss Winfrey is saying that there hasn't been a questioning of what happened is simply absurd and I'm surprised with her. Oprah is usually responsible and fair in her assessments. You may not agree with her politics but her intentions are mostly good, not on this one.
The Florida special prosecutor is investigating the case and knows far more about it than Oprah or any other TV analyst who are demanding so-called justice. The "Talking Points" believes the State of Florida will get to the bottom of what happened and take the appropriate legal action that could mean an arrests and prosecution or not. I don't believe anybody is corrupt here.
When it comes to the pundits I'm angry about the rush to judgment. When it comes to Trayvon's parents however they should be cut some slack.

SYBRINA FULTON, TRAYVON MARTIN'S MOTHER: I believe that George Zimmerman hunted my son like an animal. He tried to detain my son, my son tried to get away. And because he could not detain my son, an altercation ensued and my son was shot and killed.

O'REILLY: Now Miss Fulton is absolutely entitled to state what she believes. As a grieving mother she deserves respect; the same thing goes for Trayvon's father.

TRACY MARTIN, TRAYVON MARTIN'S FATHER: I most certainly don't know Zimmerman's character. I don't know his make-up but what I do know is that my son was racially profiled. I know that. The whole world knows that.

O'REILLY: Again, we respect Mr. Martin's opinion and the circumstantial evidence does point to racial profiling by Mr. Zimmerman but that is not... not a proved fact. And that's what's wrong with the media in this country; no longer the facts matter. Accusations are enough to condemn folks and press wants the story and doesn't care who gets hurt in the process. Allegations become front page news no matter how flimsy they are.
No media observer knows exactly what happened the night Trayvon Martin was killed yet there they are bloviating all over the place exploiting the death of a young man, inciting violence against the system, awful.
And that's "The Memo."

Speaking at a community college in Iowa yesterday, Vice President Biden attempted to thank the college president, Dr. Teresa Paper.

JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you... Terry. And thank you, Dr. Pepper. And thank you Chancellor and... Dr. Paper. Thank you, chancellor, for... for this... this partnership of yours.

O'REILLY: Well, you're welcome, Mr. Pepsi. Or something. He looks a little tired there. He was a "Pinhead", but everybody makes mistakes. Dr. Pepper.
