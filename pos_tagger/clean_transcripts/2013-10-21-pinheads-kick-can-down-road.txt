"Back of the Book" segment tonight, the "Pinheads of the Week." And we begin with Gutfeld's selection of actor Chris Noth.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED HUFFINGTON POST REPORTER: If President Obama is white, do we have a government shutdown.
CHRIS NOTH, ACTOR: Probably not. I don't think they would have -- I don't believe it.
I mean, with these Tea Party guys, maybe, maybe it was inevitable but there is something about Obama that makes these people just intolerable. And I consider then to be un-American.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: OK, now, we had Robert Redford on yesterday. I don't know whether you saw the FACTOR, but he said he was racist, too. I don't know what these guys are drinking. I mean, what is that.
GUTFELD: I have a theory. You know, that was the "Huffington Post," by the way. It's the blog for cat ladies and beta males.
Keep wondering, why do actors keep doing this. And if you take a look at Chris Noth, and you've got to wonder, he's never around when there's a Klan rally.
(LAUGHTER)
Could he be in the Klan.
O'REILLY: No, why would he be in the Klan.
GUTFELD: No? Well, I think he might.
O'REILLY: Why.
GUTFELD: You know what, the point is, he accuses us, --
O'REILLY: Yes.
GUTFELD: -- conservatives, of being racists with only by using his own psychological intent. He has no evidence, whatsoever. So, I don't need evidence to say that he's in the Klan.
O'REILLY: So, you're going to sink to his level.
GUTFELD: Oh, I'm going to exceed sinking to his level.
(LAUGHTER)
I'm diving head first into the deep end and calling him a Klan man.
O'REILLY: So, by extension, are you a "Pinhead of the Week," too.
GUTFELD: Yes. By the way, literally, a pinhead right here.
(LAUGHTER)
And this is -- notice the similarities?
O'REILLY: No, I don't.
GUTFELD: Well, look closely.
O'REILLY: No, I don't.
GUTFELD: No. But point is this, if they can do it, --
O'REILLY: Yes.
GUTFELD: -- so can we.
O'REILLY: OK, very immature. All right, now, McGuirk --
MCGUIRK: Yes, Bill.
O'REILLY: -- has selected the Dallas Texans fans. Go.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FOOTBALL GAME ANNOUNCER: Shot goes down. Chris Long. And the ball is out.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPORTS REPORTER: He goes down awkwardly on his right ankle. He comes out of the game. Texans fans actually cheering as he comes out.
UNIDENTIFIED FOOTBALL GAME ANNOUNCER: Ball dead for a sack but no fumble. And Schaub is reaching for that right ankle.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: All right. They were cheering. That's in Houston, Texas, Dallas, Texas AFL Team.
So, the fans were cheering because Matt Schaub, who's a very good quarterback and has done very well in Houston, --
MCGUIRK: In the past.
O'REILLY: Yes.
MCGUIRK: Not this year.
O'REILLY: He's having a rough year this year. But he's hurt.
MCGUIRK: Yes. No, it's just the disgrace and, you know. I mean, with these guys, the ones -- it wasn't all the fans. It was some of them. The ones who did --
O'REILLY: It was loud enough that you could hear the cheer.
MCGUIRK: Yes, that's right. And they are what totally what rhymes with "astros," which is asinine yoyos. But it's not just Houston that has a problem.
In San Francisco, over the weekend, the 49er fans, they wave while that opposition player was lying injured on the field.
O'REILLY: Yes.
MCGUIRK: It's just another manifestation of the dark side of sports. I hope --
O'REILLY: I don't know if it's the dark side of sports so much as the bread and circuses that has come into America from Ancient Rome.
GUTFELD: Hmmm.
O'REILLY: I really believe that happening. We're becoming so de- sensitized. And if you don't win right now, you're garbage.
MCGUIRK: Right, right.
GUTFELD: I mean, yesterday, I read a letter -- and this is serious, from a guy who said John McCain was a Communist. I mean, you know, you go, "How is this happening."
MCGUIRK: I heard a guy say John McCain was like the new Hanoi Jane, which is totally offensive.
O'REILLY: I think we're really getting out of control here. All right, my pinheads are across-the-board in the media. Roll the tape.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE REPORTER: Congress trying to come to an 11th hour- deal just to kick the can further down the road.
BRIAN WILLIAMS, NBC ANCHOR: And what about the fact, Senator, that the solution now kicks the can down the road.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE NEWS ANCHOR 1: I'm against this deal. I think it's a bad deal. This is a kick-the-can-down-the-road deal.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE NEWS ANCHOR 2: There's no structural reforms. There's no cost savings. It's kick the can down the road.
JOHN KING, CNN NEWS ANCHOR: There's no indication, given the policy divide. And, now, they've kicked the can into an election year.
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Will this -- I mean, we're just kicking the can down the road. Is this all going to happen again.
STEVE ISRAEL, REPRESENTATIVE, NEW YORK (D): Well, you know, Anderson, we are kicking the can. But better to kick the can than to stomp on the can.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Now, I'm going to kick some butt.
(LAUGHTER)
You, morons, have got to stop this cliche-ridden garbage. You guys are on national television. Stop with the cliches, will you.
I don't want to hear the "goal posts moving." I don't want to hear the "light is at the end of the tunnel." I don't want to see, "We have to have that conversation."
(LAUGHTER)
I don't want to hear it. I don't want -- and you're in charge on your dopey show, "The Fox Five."
GUTFELD: Yes, I am.
O'REILLY: If they do that on "The Five," you get up immediately )and stop it.
GUTFELD: I banned this two years ago.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: I heard it on your show this week.
(LAUGHTER)
MCGUIRK: Why can't we kick the can up the road.
O'REILLY: No, we can't -- we're not kicking anything, no cans, we're not kicking any butts. We're not kicking, all right.
Now, the reason I do this, and they're all pinheads -- the reason I do this -- since you're too lazy to think about what they want to say, all right, if you object to the policy not being reformed immediately, then say that.
You're driving me crazy, all right. I may have to listen to talk radio if this continues.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Don't do that.
O'REILLY: Well, McGuirk works in talk radio, you know.
MCGUIRK: That was a shock.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: Does Imus kick the can. Is he kicking can in the morning.
GUTFELD: But I think the can means something else.
MCGUIRK: By the way, he's running a half-marathon this week. And I don't see you're aware of that.
O'REILLY: Imus is running a half-marathon?
MCGUIRK: Indeed, he is.
O'REILLY: In his living room. He doesn't leave the house, does he.
MCGUIRK: Well, I'll let you know how it turns out on Monday. But he's, you know, he's not kicking anything. He's kicking butts.
O'REILLY: OK.
MCGUIRK: He's kicking cans.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: But we all agree that this has got to stop, correct.
MCGUIRK: Yes.
O'REILLY: It has --
GUTFELD: No, it will never stop. It will never stop.
O'REILLY: Even if I put you in charge.
GUTFELD: Yes. Hey, I'm incompetent.
(LAUGHTER)
O'REILLY: All right. Well, Gutfeld finally telling the truth.
