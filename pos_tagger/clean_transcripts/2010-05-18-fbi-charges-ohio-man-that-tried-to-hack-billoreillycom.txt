"Check" one: My website BillOReilly.com spends a lot of money building walls against hackers who try to destroy the enterprise. One of these men has just been arrested by the FBI. Twenty-two-year-old Mitch Frost of Belleview, Ohio, charged with a variety of federal violations. The guy allegedly tried to destroy other websites as well. The FBI did a great job investigating this cyber crime investigation, and we thank them very much.
"Check" two: Miss Oklahoma Morgan Elizabeth Woolard came in second in the Miss USA pageant, and there is speculation that her stance on the Arizona illegal immigration law might have influenced the judges.

MORGAN ELIZABETH WOOLARD, MISS OKLAHOMA: I'm a huge believer in states' rights. I think that's what's so wonderful about America. Thank you. So I think it's perfectly fine for Arizona to create that law. And I am against illegal immigration, but I'm also against racial profiling, so I see both sides in this issue.

All right. By the way, a Muslim woman, Rima Fakih, won — Miss Michigan, won the pageant. Of course, about three minutes after she won, some steamy videos of her emerged, which is shocking, right? I mean, you know, that's what this is all about these days, unfortunately. But we congratulate her and all of that.
"Check" three: As you may have heard, President Obama was in Buffalo, New York, last week touring a factory.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We've got a rocket launcher.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You've got a rocket launcher?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) the rocket launcher.
OBAMA: Let me look at the rocket launcher.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Got to get out of the way.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Got to move.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Got to move.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Except for the Fox reporter.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, everybody else needs to go that way.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, it's — seriously, these things are going to fire. Like you are almost in the line.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was great.

O'REILLY: All right. That was really a riot, wasn't it? Hey, we fire rockets on this network all the time, so return fire doesn't bother us.
"Check" four: According to the Associated Press, the Democratic Party is making a comeback. A new AP poll asks, "Do you want to see Republicans or Democrats win control of Congress?" Well, 45 percent said Democrats, 40 Republicans. That's kind of a switch from what's been going on the last few months. A bit skeptical of the sudden turnaround. As always, it could be wrong. We'll see what the other polls say this week.
"Check" five: "Saturday Night Live" closed out its season by mocking the oil spill and BP.

BILL HADER, CAST MEMBER, "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE": Tonight we've come together to assure you we have many other ideas, ideas formulated by our top scientists using state-of-the-art technology. The first plan is called dolphins with mops.
FRED ARMISEN, CAST MEMBER, "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE": That's where we round up a bunch of dolphins and Scotch tape mops to their fins.
HADER: And there are many more, like Aquaman, blame the French, duct tape. And our personal favorites, the black-up plan. That's where we blow this whole oil mess off and go see J. Lo's new romantic comedy, "The Back-up Plan." No matter what happens, we just want to assure the American people that we will stop this leak. We will clean up this mess, and we will get back to do what we do best: robbing your blind at the gas stop.

Indeed.
"Check" six: As you may know, Laura Bush has a new book out whereby she departs from her husband a bit.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LAURA BUSH, FORMER FIRST LADY: I think there are a lot of people who have trouble coming to terms with that, because they have seen marriage as traditionally between a man and a woman. But I also know that, you know, when couples are committed to each other and love each other, that they ought to have, I think, the same sort of rights that everyone has.
LARRY KING, HOST, "LARRY KING LIVE": How about choice?
BUSH: I — that was the — I write in the book about the very first question I got on the morning of George's inauguration from Katie Couric, who asked me two questions about abortion. And I think it's important that it remain legal, because I think it's important for people, for medical reasons and other reasons.
KING: So you — that would be two areas of disagreement?
BUSH: Uh-huh.

OK. And that is "Reality Check."
