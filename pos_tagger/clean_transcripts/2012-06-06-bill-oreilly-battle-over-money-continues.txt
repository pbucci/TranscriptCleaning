The election today in Wisconsin and the presidential election as well is mostly about money and how to spend it.
Liberals want the government to supply almost unlimited funds to the folks. Conservatives want fiscal responsibility in order to stabilize the economy and promote self-reliance.
That's what it's all about in Wisconsin and in America. New Gallup poll shows how the folks feel. For people making less than $36,000, President Obama is preferred over Mitt Romney 53 percent to 38 percent. Americans earning between $36,000 and $90,000 a year, Romney comes out on top 49 percent, 45 percent. For those earning $90,000 and up Romney is a choice also by a 49 percent to 45 percent margin.
Money is very important to Americans because the best material things in life are far from free. And the USA is a society that likes its comforts.
But more importantly, America's economy is built on trust. People all over the world invest here and accept dollars for things like oil because we are a stable nation, a country that pays its debts and earns its way. But that's changing under a very liberal president.
Barack Obama has made no attempt to rein in government spending, asserting that the feds can stimulate the private economy with massive investment. The result is record spending and a massive debt of about $16 trillion. Republicans reject Mr. Obama's approach and want to cut big time.
That's what Governor Scott Walker did in Wisconsin. He signed a law that makes it far more difficult for state workers to increase their compensation. Whenever you limit someone's ability to acquire money or security that person most likely will get angry.
