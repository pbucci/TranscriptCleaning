Bill O'Reilly was among those those Tuesday leading the birthday cheers for the Fox News Channel on the 18th anniversary of its launch.
The "O'Reilly Factor" host said the network continues to be a dominant force in cable news, evidenced by Nielsen ratings released last week, in which Fox topped all cable networks for weekday total primetime viewership for the first time since its 1996 launch.
"We're rolling as we enter our 19th year," O'Reilly said.
As for why "The O'Reilly Factor" has been so successful, O'Reilly said it's because the show has remained consistent over its run, and delivers commentary "that's clear, with no spin."
"Many 'Factor' viewers disagree with me on certain things," he added. "We like that, we like independent thinking. But we're authentic and honest, and that's why we continue to be on top."
On Oct. 7, 1996, the fledgling creation of News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch and Fox News CEO Roger Ailes became a reality when Fox News went live in homes across America, beginning a journey that would redefine cable news and dominate the ratings for years to come.
Fox News has been the number one cable news channel since 2002.
The historic success comes a year after Fox News recast its evening prime time lineup, introducing “The Kelly File,” which since it launched has undergone the highest ratings growth of any program in cable news.
