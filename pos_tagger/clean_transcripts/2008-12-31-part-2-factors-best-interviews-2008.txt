(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: Sanctuary cities are angry, angry, many Americans in San Francisco and Los Angeles and other cities. Won't cooperate with federal immigration law. You going to crack down on those sanctuary cities?
HILLARY CLINTON: I'm going to try to get us to where we have a...
O'REILLY: Are you going to crack down on the sanctuary cities?
CLINTON: No, I'm not, and I'll tell you why.
O'REILLY: Whoa.
CLINTON: I'm not, I'm not, because — the reason why a lot of those folks do it. In New York why do — why do police officers turn a blind eye?
O'REILLY: Because they want them to report crimes.
CLINTON: They want them to report crimes.
O'REILLY: OK. It doesn't override.
CLINTON: Because the crime — well, sometimes you have two competing values. You want to report crime. You want to protect people, and the violence spills way beyond whatever community...
O'REILLY: So why have the federal law? Abolish the immigration law. Abolish it.
CLINTON: No, we've got to fix it. No, we've got to fix it.

O'REILLY: Here's why you guys are mad at me. I embarrassed your community, because you invaded a Catholic church in San Francisco, not you yourself, but members of your community, dressed as nuns, transvestite nuns, received the Eucharist and embarrassed the priest there. And I said this is unacceptable. Not one gay leader, including yourself in San Francisco, not one criticized that action. Why?
MIKAYLA CONNELL, BOARD PRESIDENT, SAN FRANCISCO LGBT PRIDE CELEBRATION COMMITTEE: Because I don't want to criticize it.
O'REILLY: Why not?
CONNELL: It's not my place to tell the church what to do. If the church wants...
O'REILLY: It's not the church. It's the invasion of the church by members of your community. Do you think this is acceptable?
CONNELL: If the church thinks it's acceptable...
O'REILLY: They don't. They criticized it, and they were appalled by it.
CONNELL: Then the church can do what it likes.
O'REILLY: But you don't think it's appalling?
CONNELL: I don't get into the business of what the church does.
O'REILLY: It's not the church. It's your community invading the church.

O'REILLY: If they all believe Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction, sir, don't you have nerve accusing me of not being vigilant enough? Who am I supposed to believe? I've got The New York Times. I've got the president. I've got the prime minister. I've got the former president.
SCOTT MCCLELLAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: First of all, the intelligence was wrong. Now, they've looked at whether or not the intelligence analysts were pressured to change intelligence and found nothing there. But then there's the question of how the intelligence was used to make the case. And my view is, going back and looking at it, that it was packaged together in a way that made it sound more grave, more urgent and more serious than it was. And I think that if you look, you had the nuclear threat and you have intelligence that was combined together, high intelligence — intelligence, high confidence...
O'REILLY: But you're telling us...
(CROSSTALK)
O'REILLY: ... all right, seven years after the fact. I mean, look, if the president — two presidents in the United States sitting and the former CIA guy who works for both presidents, Tony Blair, and The New York Times all tell me and you, "He's got them." We can't say, "No, he doesn't."
(NEW VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: When I was working at ABC News as a correspondent, there was a rumor that you were having an affair with Fidel Castro.
BARBARA WALTERS, ABC NEWS: I know, I know.
O'REILLY: See, I always defended you. And I said, "Look, she would never have that bad taste." Because I hate this guy. I think he's a killer, a murderer, but you were able to have a rapport with him.
WALTERS: Yes. But I'm not very judgmental when I do an interview. I'm trying to say, this is who the person is. Take a look. If Usama bin Laden called me tomorrow — a reporter asked about this - - and said, "Come do an interview," I would go.
O'REILLY: ...but to be friends with them.
WALTERS: No. But I wasn't...
O'REILLY: See, Castro liked you. You think he liked me? I don't think so.
WALTERS: No, but, you know, sometimes it's your personality, Bill. I'd like to discuss with you your personality. There are different ways of getting an interview.
O'REILLY: That's for sure.
(NEW VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Is the war on terrorism largely our fault?
TED TURNER, MEDIA MOGUL: No, I wouldn't say largely, but I think that if we would stopped bombing people and sent doctors and scientists and engineers around the world, that we'd make a lot more progress. And we wouldn't have near as much terrorism in the world as we do. I think that bombing just makes people angry, and they want to bomb you back.
O'REILLY: Well, I think they bombed us first, but...
TURNER: Who did?
O'REILLY: You know, the terrorists on 9/11.
TURNER: They didn't in Vietnam. In Vietnam we bombed them first.
O'REILLY: All right, look, you can argue — you can argue the Vietnam War. And I think there are two legitimate sides. But I want to keep it current, because there, you know — there's one man who's done more for the continent of Africa than any other man in the history of civilization. Do you know who that man is?
TURNER: Nelson Mandela?
O'REILLY: No, President Bush has saved more lives, sent more money, and provided more medical care for the citizens of all the countries of Africa than any human being that's ever lived. Yet, you just said, "Send the doctors. Send this; send that. The world will like us better. And there won't be this terrorism." We've — we've done that.
(NEW VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: All right, the first one is snake wrangler.
MIKE ROWE, HOST, DISCOVERY CHANNEL'S "DIRTY JOBS": You catch the water snake and you make it vomit. And then you look under a microscope at the puke to make sure it is of a healthy consistency. What she doesn't tell you is that, when you grab the water snake, they have a mouth full of teeth, and they will bite you.
O'REILLY: There's no poison.
ROWE: There's no poison.
O'REILLY: They just bite?
ROWE: Just pure pain.
O'REILLY: The last one, horse inseminator. A person has to do this.
ROWE: Absolutely.
O'REILLY: Not a machine.
ROWE: No, no, no.
O'REILLY: It's got to be done by hand.
ROWE: No, you need the opposable thumb, believe me.
O'REILLY: OK. So are you in charge of the whole process from soup to nuts?
ROWE: Well, my job on the show is — that's not bad.
O'REILLY: Thank you.
ROWE: My job on the show is to always be the apprentice.
O'REILLY: What does that pay?
ROWE: That's not bad. Plus, the horse still calls you.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
O'REILLY: That segment was the worst jobs in the world.
