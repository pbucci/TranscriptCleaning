With national health care now a reality, the next major controversy for the Obama administration is what to do with the 12 million illegal aliens currently residing in the USA.
It is clear that the American people have had enough. Seventy percent of Arizona residents support that state's tough new anti-illegal alien law, and 60 percent of all Americans support it as well.
But the opposition is very vocal, with some big names on board:

GOV. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: I was also to go and give a commencement speech in Arizona, but with my accent I was worried they're going to deport me back to Austria, so I cancelled that idea right away.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Now, Governor Schwarzenegger is done as a politician, so he can say what he wants. But other Republicans are mostly on the other side of the issue.
Sen. John McCain is fighting for his political life in Arizona, and while McCain used to be a moderate on illegal immigration, he is now a warrior:

SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: Drug and human smuggling, home invasions, murder.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're outmanned. Of all the illegals in America, more than half come through Arizona.
MCCAIN: Have we got the right plan?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The plan's perfect. You bring troops, state, county and local law enforcement together.
MCCAIN: And complete the dang fence.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It will work this time. Senator, you're one of us.
MCCAIN: I'm John McCain, and I approve this message.

Glenn Beck, among others, is criticizing Mr. McCain for being hypocritical, but perhaps the senator just wised up. Voters will make the call.
The Obama administration could introduce a national immigration reform bill right now. They could do that, but they will not. The issue is simply too hot.
So liberal America must try to persuade independent America to support the pathway to citizenship vision. Here's how Nancy Pelosi is going about that:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Cardinals, the archbishops, the bishops come to me and say we want you to pass immigration reform. And I said but I want you to speak about it from the pulpit. I want you to instruct your â€” whatever the communication is, the people, some of whom oppose immigration reform are sitting in those pews, and you have to tell them that this is a manifestation of our living the gospels.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
So let me get this straight: Speaker Pelosi wants a pro-immigration point of view in church? Wow. What about the wall of separation? Isn't that a great liberal tenet? Would the Speaker support preachers urging fiscal responsibility from the pulpit? Just asking.
Bottom line: Once again, the feds simply don't know what to do about illegal immigration. But the folks do know. Secure the border once and for all, and then pass an immigration law that is built on fairness, not ideology.
And that's "The Memo."
Pinheads & Patriots
As you know, "The Factor" believes in political expression, even from famous people.
Here's the latest Sarah Palin knock, this one by Henry Winkler:

HENRY WINKLER, ACTOR: I do know that she is the most articulate member of her family. Really. No, really, I mean, you know. OK, but here it is. I mean, it's a wonderful thing. People listen to her and believe that she knows. I think that is incredible, that this woman of very little knowledge is out there talking up a storm.

Now, if you are liberal, you may think Mr. Winkler is a patriot. If you're conservative, the opposite.

But there is no question about this statement by BBC correspondent Katty Kay:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KATTY KAY, BBC CORRESPONDENT: I've heard moderate Muslims here in America say to me they have known people who were moderate, law-abiding Muslims when they felt racial screening when they were at airports have actually then turned towards extremism.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
So airport screening now causes terrorism? Ms. Kay could be a pinhead.
