By Bill O'Reilly

As you may know, I am doing some media in support of my new book, "Pinheads and Patriots: Where You Stand in the Age of Obama."

As part of that, I went on "The View" Thursday morning and was asked why President Obama's poll numbers are falling. That ignited a fiery debate:

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BILL O'REILLY: Two things are driving President Obama's poll numbers down and driving him individually crazy, because he didn't expect any of this. The economy is just flat, all right? Numbers came out today. Again, they are not good. So that -- that's No. 1. But No. 2.

BARBARA WALTERS, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Again, he inherited a lot of it and…

O'REILLY: But, the statute of limitations have run out on that. He spent a trillion dollars. Yes. Yes. Look, when you spend a trillion dollars trying to turn it around and it doesn't work, that's on you, OK? It's not on the pinheads before you.

WALTERS: What should be done?

O'REILLY: All right, microeconomics is not my deal.

WALTERS: OK.

O'REILLY: I'm just explaining why his numbers are down. So the people see a trillion dollars of their tax money and nothing to show for it yet. But they also see a widening gulf between the president and them personally, and that's what I write about in "Pinheads and Patriots."

WALTERS: I know, but what does that…

O'REILLY: All right, let me give an example. The mosque -- the mosque down here on 9/11, that's inappropriate. It's -- sure, they have a right to do it and in the Constitution, but it's inappropriate because a lot of the 9/11 families, who I know, say, "Look, we don't want that. It shouldn't be there."

WALTERS: What about the discussion?

O'REILLY: No, no, no. No, no, no. But there is the president -- there is the president going, "Well, they have a right to do it." And, then the guy said…

JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Yes! This is America. This is America.

O'REILLY: Hold it! Hold it! Listen to me because you'll learn.

BEHAR: Pinhead. Pinhead.

O'REILLY: Thank you! So he says to the press, "Yes, they have a right to do it" and that's true.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Yes?

O'REILLY: And then the question is, "But what about the wisdom of it, Mr. President? And, he goes "I'm not going to comment," where upon everybody in the country goes, "What?"

BEHAR: We're Americans. We agree with him.

O'REILLY: You agree with him. Most Americans…

BEHAR: No, we're Americans. I'm an American.

O'REILLY: Let me break this to you: 70 percent of Americans don't want that mosque down there.

BEHAR: Where is that poll?

O'REILLY: So don't give me the "we" business.

BEHAR: Where is that poll? I want to see that poll.

O'REILLY: Do you want to bet on that? Do you want to bet? I will show you that poll in a minute.

BEHAR: All I'm saying is I'm American, too.

GOLDBERG: Seventy percent of Americans don't want…

O'REILLY: Yes! Seventy percent.

GOLDBERG: …don't want it there.

BEHAR: Why is that?

GOLDBERG: But why are we saying…

O'REILLY: Because it is inappropriate.

GOLDBERG: Why is it inappropriate if 70 percent…

(CROSSTALK)

O'REILLY: Muslims killed us on 9/11.

GOLDBERG: No! Oh my God! That is (EXPLETIVE DELETED.)

O'REILLY: Muslims didn't kill us on 9/11, is that what you're saying?

GOLDBERG: Extremists. Excuse me, extremists…

(CROSSTALK)

BEHAR: What religion was Mr. McVeigh?

O'REILLY: I'm telling you, 70 percent of the…

BEHAR: I don't want to sit here now. I don't sit here.

O'REILLY: Go. Go.

BEHAR: I'm outraged by that statement.

O'REILLY: You are outraged about Muslims killed us on 9/11?

(GOLDBERG AND BEHAR WALK OFF SET)

WALTERS: I want to say something. I want to say something to all of you. You have just seen what should not happen. We should be able to have discussions without washing our hands and screaming and walking off stage. I love my colleagues. That should not have happened. Now, let me just say to you in a calmer voice. It was extremists. You cannot take a whole religion and demean them because…

O'REILLY: I'm not demeaning anybody.

WALTERS: Yes, you are.

O'REILLY: No, I'm not.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

Both Ms. Goldberg and Ms. Behar returned to the set, and the discussion resumed:

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

WALTERS: Today you are a pinhead.

O'REILLY: No, I don't think so. I will disagree with that. I think I tell it like it is.

SHERRI SHEPHERD, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": But, Bill -- but Bill, you are a pinhead because I believe you knew what you said when you said Muslims. And then you came back and you made a distinction.

O'REILLY: All right, look, again, we are discussing an issue that is very complicated. And I assume that people understand Muslim terrorists. The assumption was that we were attacked by a certain people and that has to be in the nation's consciousness.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

The poll I cited was taken by CNN in August. About 70 percent of Americans, as I said, agree with me on the Ground Zero mosque issue. It's inappropriate.

No one I know wants to insult Muslims, but almost everybody I know is tired of the political correctness surrounding the 9/11 attack.

The truth is that if moderate Muslims all over the world would stand with America against radical Islam, the terrorists could not exist. But obviously that isn't happening.

I am not in the business of sugarcoating harsh reality. This program and my books state the truth as I see it. I enjoy jousting with "The View" ladies because, with the exception of Elizabeth Hasselbeck, they do not see it my way, and I want their audience to hear both sides.

I loved that exposition on Thursday, didn't you?

And that's "The Memo."

Pinheads & Patriots

Recently on "Fox & Friends," Vanilla Ice the rapper appeared. In anticipation of that, there was this:


So are the ladies pinheads or patriots for that sequence? I'm voting patriot. They look pretty good to me.

Last night Vince Vaughn's movie trailer was the "P & P" subject:

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

VINCE VAUGHN, ACTOR: Ladies and gentlemen, electric cars are gay. I mean, not homosexual gay, but, you know, "my parents are chaperoning the dance" gay.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

That trailer has now been pulled from the theatres. Eighty-six percent of you say that was a pinheaded move; 14 percent patriotic.
