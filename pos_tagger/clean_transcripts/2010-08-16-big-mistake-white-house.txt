It is hard to believe, but President Obama has once again alienated millions of Americans by inserting himself in a controversy that can do him no good at all.
As you may know, some Muslims want to build a mosque a couple of blocks away from Ground Zero in New York City. This has caused much anger. Some 9/11 families believe it is insensitive because members of the Islamic faith killed their loved ones.
Nationally, a new Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll says that 64 percent of Americans say it is wrong to build a mosque near Ground Zero, and that number includes 56 percent of Democrats. Just 30 percent believe it is appropriate.
President Obama is framing the issue as a freedom of religion deal, but that's not what it's about.
The same Fox News poll says 61 percent of Americans believe the Muslim group has a right to build the mosque, and they do legally. But this is not about legalisms. It's about sensitivity towards thousands of Americans who lost loved ones in the 9/11 attack.
Nevertheless, the president said this:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT OBAMA: As a citizen, and as president, I believe that Muslims have the right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country. And that includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan in accordance with local laws and ordnances.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Well, after the president made that statement, all hell broke loose, and the next day he had to walk it back a bit:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: My intention was to simply let people know what I thought, which was that in this country we treat everybody equally in accordance with the law regardless of race, regardless of religion. I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom of making a decision to put a mosque there.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
But why won't you comment on the wisdom of putting the mosque there, Mr. President? You're the leader of this nation. The action is certainly inappropriate, and even some Muslims understand that:

RAHEEL RAZA, MUSLIM CANADIAN CONGRESS BOARD MEMBER: Building a mosque or a place of worship in the particular spot across the street from Ground Zero is a slap in the face of all Americans. I can't begin to imagine how they would even conceive an idea that building a mosque there, which is an exclusive place of prayer for Muslims, would in any way build tolerance and respect.

Here's the bottom line on the mosque situation. Once again, President Obama goes up against the will of the people, but for what purpose? What is to be gained here?
This is another in a long line of dubious decisions by the president, so here's my advice to the White House: Why don't you help these guys build the mosque and then try the mastermind of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in it? That way you can combine two insane things together.
And that's "The Memo."
Pinheads & Patriots
It is state fair time all across the USA, and in Illinois and other Midwestern states, that means hog calling:

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here pig, pig, piggy! Here, pig, pig, pig, pig, piggy! (PIG NOISES)

Is that guy a patriot? Not if you're a hog. He's annoying.
On the pinhead front, our pal Dan Rather is in an upcoming movie called "Skyline," where he talks to the audience about a scientist named Stephen Hawking who believes aliens are getting ready to invade:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAN RATHER, FORMER CBS NEWS ANCHOR: Hawking says if extraterrestrials visit, the outcome might be similar to when Columbus landed in America. In other words, it didn't turn out too well for Native Americans.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
We hope the aliens will be kind when they come to visit. Is Mr. Rather a pinhead for getting involved with that project? You make the call, but I don't think so. He's just having a little fun.
