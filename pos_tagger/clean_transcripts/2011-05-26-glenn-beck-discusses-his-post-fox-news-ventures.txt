BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "At Your Beck and Call" segment tonight: As you may know, the Beckmeister will be leaving Fox News later on this year, and he has a number of other ventures in the wind. And here he is to explain one of them.

GLENN BECK, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I don't know what he's talking about.
O'REILLY: GBTV. Very snappy, Beck. GBTV. It rhymes and everything.
BECK: We haven't announced anything like that.

O'REILLY: How come it's all over the Internet, though? I mean, it says Glenn Beck...

BECK: So if it's on the Internet it must be true?
O'REILLY: I don't know if it's true or not. It's on the Internet. I don't really care. But people do ask me though.
BECK: Do they? They keep him in a closet here at Fox. They roll him out.

O'REILLY: What is Beck going to do after he leaves his daily program on television?

BECK: I've got a metal detector, and I'm going to the beach.
O'REILLY: I can see that.
BECK: Looking for things buried in the sand.
O'REILLY: And then as you pass people on the blanket, you'll be going, "You know, the world is going to end soon."
BECK: By the way, I saw you on "Imus." That wasn't right; that wasn't right.

O'REILLY: What did I do?

BECK: Talking about my new clothing line of apocalyptic -- Apocalypse Now.
O'REILLY: That was a great line.

BECK: He blew the big announcement.
O'REILLY: I was on "Imus" this morning, ladies and gentlemen, and they asked me, you know, what Beck is going to do. I said, "I think he's got a new clothing line called Apocalypse Now." Little shirts and jackets. You ought to do that. You'd make a fortune. Give it to charity like I do.
BECK: You know what? I will make an announcement here.
O'REILLY: Do that.
BECK: I am doing a clothing line, but it will be for charity.

O'REILLY: Good. Just like we do.

BECK: Yes. And it will be called 1791, the Original Blueprint. And, it is, well...

O'REILLY: 1791, the Original Blueprint of?
BECK: That's just the name. It's like Ralph Lauren of?

O'REILLY: OK, so what is the significance of the 1791 date…
BECK: Am I talking to Bill O'Reilly?
O'REILLY: …for a clothing thing? Define it for us, please.

BECK: It's the Bill -- that's when the Bill of Rights happened.

O'REILLY: The Bill of Rights, all right. There you go. There you go. OK.
BECK: Need to go back to the original blueprint. And so the clothing will actually have things all over inside the clothing to remind you of -- to go back and be who you are supposed to be.

O'REILLY: Not only attire but it's a philosophical…
BECK: It's philosophical. It's a way of life. And it's also going to be kind of like Newman's Own. I'm going to do to clothing...

O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: ...what Newman did to salad dressing.
O'REILLY: I thought you meant Alfred E. Neuman on the magazine.
BECK: No, no.

O'REILLY: Paul Newman. Not Alfred E.

BECK: No, no, no.

O'REILLY: Paul Newman. I get confused. All right. Now, let's get back to this GBTV, because I do believe you are going...

BECK: I don't know what you're talking about.

O'REILLY: I know. But you are going to be doing television on the Internet. I do believe that's going to happen for you.

BECK: Hang on just a second. Hang on. It's probably not something we should talk about on the air. But are you asking me for a job, Bill?

O'REILLY: Yes, absolutely.
BECK: Because I do pay in carrots.

O'REILLY: That's all right. I'll take the gold like you do.

BECK: Yes.

O'REILLY: But if you did do a television network on the Internet, you know, it would be themed like your clothing line, right? There would be a theme to GBTV.
BECK: We're in the hypothetical word now?

O'REILLY: Oh, absolutely.

BECK: Yes. There would be a theme. It would be all cartoons. It would be all cartoons.

O'REILLY: Like Huckabee is doing? Cartoons to illustrate what history is? Huckabee has got that.
BECK: Yes, he does have that. No, it wouldn't be like that.

O'REILLY: You as a superhero?

BECK: Now, there's an idea.
O'REILLY: Big G?
BECK: Or the adventures of Spooky Dude.
O'REILLY: Oh, he would sue your butt off though.
BECK: Soros.
O'REILLY: He'd sue.
BECK: He would look good in tights and a cape.
O'REILLY: Now, is this false, too, that you're giving out coupons? That you're -- you've got some warehouse and you're going to save everybody money?
BECK: No, I'm not going to be giving out coupons.
O'REILLY: What are you doing?
BECK: I'm not giving out -- what is it?
O'REILLY: What's this discount stuff you're doing? You're merchandising?
BECK: That is something that my company is also doing that is called Markdown, which is not -- you know, these Groupon websites, they've got a billion things. And you know, you can get your hair removed or whatever. We are looking for -- this is actually -- we just kicked this off this week. But there's a place on the website where you can go if you're an entrepreneur and you can say, "If I could just get people to try my product..."
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: "...I believe, you know, I can change the world or whatever."
O'REILLY: You're going to help the small business people?
BECK: Yes.
O'REILLY: By giving Americans a chance to sample a product at a good price.
BECK: Yes. We launched with Chocolates.com, which is a...
O'REILLY: Chocolates.com?
BECK: …which is a site that actually has found 250 small chocolate makers here in America. This guy was a small chocolate maker at one point.
O'REILLY: I like this, Beck. So Beck is actually -- you are doing good by helping American small business people get established through the power of your website.
BECK: Yes. Yes.
O'REILLY: This could -- you know, I'm going to call the pope. This could be canonization for you, Beck. This could be getting you in line, you know?
BECK: This is not helping you. If this is a job interview, this is not helping you, Mr. O'Reilly.
O'REILLY: I'm trying to give you a compliment.
BECK: It doesn't sound like one.

O'REILLY: Now, do you get a piece of the chocolate? Do you get free chocolate forever?

BECK: I get paid in chocolate. You, carrots.

O'REILLY: OK, but you see the difference between my physique...
BECK: This isn't going well for me, is it? This is really not.
O'REILLY: They're sympathizing with you.
BECK: That's right. That's right.

O'REILLY: The crew is sympathizing. It's chocolate vs. carrots, everybody. And Beck is a good 20 years younger than I am.
BECK: OK, all right. This is not working. Next. We've seen your reel, Mr. O'Reilly. Thank you for stopping by.
O'REILLY: Did anybody ever tell you that you look like George Gobel? Did anybody ever say that?
BECK: No.
O'REILLY: I've got to go, Beck.
