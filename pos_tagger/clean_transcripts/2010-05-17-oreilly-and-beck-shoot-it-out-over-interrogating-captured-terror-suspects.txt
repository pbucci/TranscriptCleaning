BILL O'REILLY, HOST: In the "At Your Beck and Call" segment tonight: Our pal Glenn has been praised this week by some far-left loons because of Beck's stand on Miranda rights. The issue's pretty clear. I believe the public safety exception — that is when a terrorist act is underway — a suspect is denied Miranda rights so authorities can more easily get information. That must be the law of the land. Beck says no, that Miranda must be applied upon arrest to American citizens. We debated it last night.

O'REILLY: All right, Beck, you are in big trouble now.

GLENN BECK, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I am.
O'REILLY: The far left liking you.
BECK: Yes.
O'REILLY: Liking you. Let me roll this clip. Go.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JON STEWART, HOST, "THE DAILY SHOW": Roll tape of someone being far more reasonable about reading a suspect his Miranda rights, please.
BECK: He has all the rights under the Constitution. Again, it's not a popular answer, but I don't think that we shred the Constitution.
STEVE DOOCY, CO-HOST, "FOX & FRIENDS": Right.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BECK: That was early in the morning. I didn't even think about it. I mean, I didn't even know what was going on.
O'REILLY: You were delirious when you said that.
BECK: I know. I couldn't believe that that's even a possibility. A citizen…
O'REILLY: The — this is where, you believe that these terrorists should be read their Miranda rights right away. I think you're wrong, but I understand where you're coming from.
BECK: No, no, no. Citizens, Bill. Citizens.
O'REILLY: Terrorists, some terrorists are citizens.
BECK: Yes, and here is what you have. Remember, we're running this like a police operation. So, if the police bust you, when does that citizen become guilty? I thought we had to prove that.
O'REILLY: No, but here's the deal. They want to pass a law that says if there's an imminent threat of a terror act...
BECK: Look, I am all for Jack Bauer.
O'REILLY: ...that's suspended.
BECK: Nipple clamps go on if we're 24 hours away and we think a bomb is going to go off.
O'REILLY: Let's pass a law that says if the authorities feel there's a terror act underway...
BECK: No way. No.
O'REILLY: ...Miranda rights can be suspended.
BECK: No more power.
O'REILLY: I disagree with you 1,000 percent on this. You've got to deal with reality.
BECK: You've got a government right now.
O'REILLY: Oh, stop.
BECK: You've got a government right now who is saying that the Tea Partygoers are terrorists and everybody else. You've already had a report on that.
O'REILLY: You're a history guy. I mean, I watch your show, and you've got Benjamin Franklin running around. You've got George Washington. Do you know that Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the Civil War?
BECK: I absolutely did. During the civil what?
O'REILLY: War.
BECK: War. Yes. When this government decides to declare war, then you can talk to me.
O'REILLY: This is a War on Terror.
BECK: It is a contingency plan now, Bill.
O'REILLY: Look, you're cutting hairs here.
BECK: No, I'm not.
O'REILLY: I'm trying to save lives.
BECK: Bill, let me ask you this. I want to do the same thing. I am for — you know me. I am strong on defense. I believe these people are terrorists. I take these people in Washington apart every time because they're wusses. They won't do the right thing. But you ask this question of yourself. Why, all of a sudden, are the usual suspects that are, "No, no, no torture. No, we've got to try the hairy, fat guy here in New York. We've got to give these guys cupcakes when we bring them over here." Why, why, all of a sudden are they saying, "Well, now wait a minute? Let's not."
O'REILLY: Because popular opinion is against them.
BECK: Bullcrap. Not true. Not true.
O'REILLY: What's the reason?
BECK: You have — you have Cass Sunstein, talking about, now, government.
O'REILLY: Tell me the reason...
BECK: They are setting up the American people.
O'REILLY: Setting us up for what?
BECK: What do you think?
O'REILLY: I have no idea. What's the conspiracy of the day?
BECK: There's not a conspiracy.
O'REILLY: What are they setting us up here?
BECK: There is not a conspiracy here. They are already talking about silencing free speech. They already are. Did you see the president's speech on Saturday?
O'REILLY: I'm not buying it. I am...
BECK: Bill, you didn't buy it a year ago that the guy was a Marxist.
O'REILLY: And I'm still yapping, and so are you. We're still yapping, OK?
BECK: Did you see the president's speech?
O'REILLY: Look, I saw 18,000 of his speeches.
BECK: Did you see the one Saturday...
O'REILLY: OK.
BECK: ...when he said there can be too much information.
O'REILLY: That was from the gizmo.
BECK: No.
O'REILLY: Talking about the gizmos.
BECK: No, he was not.
O'REILLY: Yes, he was.
BECK: No, he wasn't.
O'REILLY: All right, just think about it. We need to — we need to protect...
BECK: Could be you.
O'REILLY: Just like FISA, we need to protect American people by broadening out laws to protect us against terrorism. A little bit.
BECK: Not a little bit. Without warrants. They are already — DOJ, wait a minute. DOJ is already saying you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy of location, OK? Don't need a warrant to say, "Where is Bill O'Reilly?"
O'REILLY: I got you.
BECK: You don't have a reasonable right — you don't have a reasonable right for reading e-mails.
O'REILLY: It's all about targeting and micro law. I know what you're saying, the slippery slope. I don't subscribe to that in many cases, but I understand it.
OK. Now, you have a beef with me over "Iron Man 2"? Is that what I'm hearing?
BECK: Yes, I do. You wrecked my movie-going experience.
O'REILLY: I wrecked it?
BECK: You wrecked my movie-going experience.
O'REILLY: How did I do that?
BECK: You're Bill O'Reilly. I'm looking for some hot chicks on the screen or something.
O'REILLY: Is that why you go to the movie? And you're going to "Iron Man" to look for hot chicks? Is that what you're telling me?
BECK: Look, Bill.
O'REILLY: Can you not read the advertisement?
BECK: I don't even — I don't go to rated "R" movies. I have very few pleasures in life.
O'REILLY: It's not "R." It's "PG."
BECK: I know. That's as close as I can get to seeing hot chicks. I'm sitting there, and I'm like, "It's Bill O'Reilly. I can get this at work."
O'REILLY: There's only one guy in America that can handle "Iron Man." Only one.
BECK: Did you see the way...
O'REILLY: I didn't see the movie, but I slap him around, do I not?
BECK: People can be too successful. He's in a major motion picture. "I didn't see it. I was out — I was out with the gardening staff."
O'REILLY: I'm busy trying to keep you in line, Beck. It takes so many hours.
BECK: Will you do me a favor?
O'REILLY: Yes.
BECK: Not you. Let me talk to you. Would you please — we have the — what do we call it? Bold Fresh Tour, yes. And we just added a show. It's in Westbury. That's in Long Island. That's going to sell out right away. St. Louis and Columbus, Ohio, June 18 and 19. Tickets are on sale at BoldFreshTour.com, GlennBeck.com. You can find them there.
O'REILLY: And everyone who comes to the show is going to have to wear a pin like that. Is that from the Martians in Venice? Or who sent you that one?
BECK: What pin — what pin is on the top of your head? Pinhead?
O'REILLY: Stealing my material, Beck. There you go. You got another pin?
BECK: Yes. It's the state police of New Jersey.
O'REILLY: State police of New Jersey.
BECK: Do you want to ask why?
O'REILLY: Yes, please.
BECK: I can't tell you.
O'REILLY: All right. Are they going to...
BECK: You better not speed on your way home.
O'REILLY: Glenn Beck, everybody. King of the pins. You can fill in "head" if you'd like.
