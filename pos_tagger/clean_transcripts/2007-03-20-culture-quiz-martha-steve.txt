BILL O'REILLY, HOST: "Back of the Book" segment. Tonight, the second installment of "The Great American Culture Quiz", where we ask you five questions to see how much you know about American pop culture.
Here to help us out, Steve Doocy, who got all of the questions right last week, which was a disgrace, and Martha MacCallum, who got four out of five. So today we've toughened them up.
Now, these are multiple choice. I'm going to read you the question, give you the, you know, choices. And then you don't have a lot of time. This isn't one of those dopey TV shows on, you know, NBC.
MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Can we call someone?
O'REILLY: No crying, either.
STEVE DOOCY, CO-HOST, "FOX & FRIENDS": You're no Howie Mandell.
O'REILLY: That's for sure. On which network did Bill Clinton answer the infamous boxers or briefs question? A, NBC; B, Comedy Central; C, MTV; D, VH1.
All right. What's your answer, Martha?
MACCALLUM: C.
O'REILLY: What's your answer, Doocy?
DOOCY: C.
O'REILLY: Is that right? Was that right?
DOOCY: It is right.
O'REILLY: Wrong.
DOOCY: What?
O'REILLY: Was it? Did I get it wrong? So you both got them right. C, MTV.
President Bush the elder launched Operation Restore Hope. What country did it take place in? A, Bosnia; B, Rwanda; C, Somalia; D, Kuwait.
Operation Restore Hope. Doocy.
DOOCY: Can I see them again?
O'REILLY: No, this isn't fifth grade, Doocy. Do you know the answer or not?
I knew you wouldn't get this. You know nothing about — D, A, both wrong. Kuwait, Doocy? A, Bosnia?
Somalia. That was "Black Hawk Down".
DOOCY: That was my next choice.
O'REILLY: That was Black Hawk Down. I bet you all you guys at home got that.
DOOCY: That's a good question.
O'REILLY: "Black Hawk Down". Here's a better question. The Blob terrorized a small American town and only one guy figured it out. Not Brian Kilmeade. What actor played the guy? Warren Beatty; James Garner; C, James Dean; D, Steve McQueen?
Who saved the world from The Blob? MacCallum has Steve McQueen.
MACCALLUM: Love Steve McQueen.
O'REILLY: Who do you have? C. You believe — you're telling me, Doocy, that you believe James Dean was in "The Blob"? Is that what you're telling me?
DOOCY: I thought it was Jimmy Dean. Sorry.
O'REILLY: James Dean, "East of Eden", the esteemed actor. You're telling me — MacCallum is right. MacCallum is ahead. Steve McQueen, first movie was "The Blob".
MACCALLUM: He was great in "The Blob".
O'REILLY: Now if anybody knows this, I'm impressed. Who wrote the theme song to "The Blob"?
MACCALLUM: No clue.
O'REILLY: Burt Bacharach. And it was sung by? The Five Blobs. Am I only one who knows "The Blob" here?
MACCALLUM: You're the only one who knows the Five Blobs.
O'REILLY: Burt Bacharach wrote the theme song for "The Blob". I'll sing it next week.
No. 4, Bill Cosby co-starred in a hit program called "I Spy". Who was the other lead? A, Sidney Poitier; B, Jack Lard; C, Robert Culp; D, Robert Vaughn.
Who was the other lead with Bill Cosby? Doocy, C. C. MacCallum, D. MacCallum, you're doubting your wisdom or what?
MACCALLUM: I think it's D.
O'REILLY: Do you know Robert Vaughn?
MACCALLUM: Yes.
O'REILLY: Do you know who Robert Vaughn is?
MACCALLUM: Yes.
DOOCY: "The Man from U.N.C.L.E."
MACCALLUM: "The Man from U.N.C.L.E."
O'REILLY: How could he be "I Spy" and — how could he be in both shows at the same time?
MACCALLUM: U.N.C.L.E.
O'REILLY: How could he? Doocy got it right. What a disgrace. Robert Culp.
MACCALLUM: Lucille Ball, did she do anything.
O'REILLY: You have to — you have to deduce if you don't know. If he's in "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.", he can't be in "I Spy". He can't be in both.
MACCALLUM: It's right.
O'REILLY: All right. Final question, and this is one of my favorites. Ann Margaret became a star in the movie "Bye Bye Birdie". Which actor played her father and then went on to game show fame? Richard Dawson; Wink Martindale; Monty Hall; Paul Lynde.
Her father in "Bye Bye Birdie".
Doocy, D. Doocy, Doocy, Doocy. D, Paul Lynde. D, correct. You're both correct. Paul Lynde. You didn't know. You just guessed. Now you weren't cribbing off him.
MACCALLUM: I know "Bye Bye Birdie".
O'REILLY: You weren't cribbing off him?
MACCALLUM: No.
O'REILLY: Paul Lynde was the dad. And what was his famous line? No idea.
MACCALLUM: Kids today. What are you going to do with kids today?
O'REILLY: Very good. Martha MacCallum, what's the matter with kids today? Why can't they be like I am?
MACCALLUM: Yes. Perfect in every way.
O'REILLY: She's so much better than you, Doocy. She's so much better.
MACCALLUM: And who was that movie about?
O'REILLY: I just want everybody to know, because we're going to come back next week with these two, that Doocy thought James Dean was in "The Blob". All right. You got that wrong.
MacCallum, you win tonight.
MACCALLUM: Awesome.
DOOCY: It was fixed!
O'REILLY: She just blew it with using the word awesome. Now I really think I'm on American Bandstand.
