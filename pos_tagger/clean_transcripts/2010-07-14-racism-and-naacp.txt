This week in Kansas City, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People held its annual convention, and racism was a featured topic.

BEN JEALOUS, NAACP PRESIDENT: It is time to warn the people that racism and hate is still alive in America! That we must wake up and get about our father's business and our mama's business, the business of tearing down the walls of racism, poverty, discrimination and bigotry.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Well that's true. Racism and bigotry are alive in America, just as they exist in every nation on Earth. Every one.
But what Mr. Jealous will not say is that racism cuts both ways. We'll get to that in a moment.
But let's get back to the NAACP president, who goes on to attack the Tea Party.

JEALOUS: And in the middle of this great American nightmare, here comes the genetic descendent of the White Citizens' Council, burst from its coffin, carrying signs with slogans like lynch Barack Hussein Obama and lynch Eric Holder.
Expel the bigots and racists in your ranks, or take full responsibility for all of their actions.

Now, we could not find those signs that Mr. Jealous referred to, and it is impossible for anybody to take responsibility for anything that their members do. Again, every nation, every organization, every concern in the world has some kind of bigotry in it. It's just a human condition.
That's not to say it's justified, and if overt racism is demonstrated, it has to be called out. But if Mr. Jealous thinks there's no racism in his own organization, he's insane.
Finally, Mr. Jealous went after Sarah Palin.

JEALOUS: Sarah Palin says let's party like it's 1776. My white daddy would say be careful what you wish for, because the 18th century, Sarah, wasn't good for nobody, even folks like you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Gov. Palin replied on Facebook, saying: "The Tea Party movement is not racist or motivated by racism. It is motivated by love of country and all that is good and honest about our proud and diverse nation."
From the beginning of the Tea Party ascent, the far left has labeled it a racist organization. That's what these people do. If they don't like you, you're a bigot.
"Talking Points" is very disappointed that the NAACP is buying this nonsense, and it is perplexing because the organization does not condemn stuff like this.

SAMIR SHABAZZ, NEW BLACK PANTHER: I hate white people. All of them. Every last iota of a cracker, I hate them. What the hell wrong with you, black man? You had a (INAUDIBLE) day with a white girl on your damn arm. If you want freedom, you're gonna have to kill some crackers. You're gonna have to kill some of their babies.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
We didn't hear a word about the New Black Panther Party from the NAACP, even though they're involved in a huge controversy with the Justice Department.
So a case could be made that the NAACP is color-blind on racism. If blacks are the perpetrators, they ignore it. Or am I wrong?
And that's "The Memo."

BARBARA WALTERS, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Two months today since I had my surgery, and I am fully recovered! I'm so glad to be alive. I'm so glad to talk to all of you. And I hope that I'll be able to talk when I see you in September, because I'll be back the first day we come back.

For maintaining her icon status, Ms. Walters is a patriot.
On the pinhead front, poor Ronald Reagan.

ALEX TREBEK, HOST, "JEOPARDY": Say the name of this man you see shaking hands with the premier of China. Andrea.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who is Nixon?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who is JFK?
TREBEK: No. Who is the late President Reagan?

Are those kids pinheads? You make the call.
